# Construct design for transgenesis

We designed synthetic constructs with the invaluable help from Radim Žídek.

- [`0-Plasmid_backbone`](0-Plasmid_backbone): Vector and other backbone elements.
- [`1-Insert_design`](1-Insert_design): Similar insert using the eve stripe 1 enhancer.
- [`2-Elements`](2-Elements): Promoter, enhancer, and DN-Rho1 sequences for insert.
- [`3-Constructs`](3-Constructs): 
- [`4-Orders`](4-Orders): 
- [`5-Plasmids`](5-Plasmids):
