# Split-GAL4 experiments

The goal of the split-GAL4 experiments is to block cephalic furrow formation by inhibiting myosin activity specifically in the initiator cells.

## Experiments

- eve-btd-GAL4 > UAS-DNRho1: express dominant negative Rho1 in btd--eve-expressing cells (initiators).
- Dfd-eve-GAL4 > UAS-DNRho1: express dominant negative Rho1 in Dfd--eve-expressing cells (eve stripe 1).
