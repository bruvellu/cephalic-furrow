# Tissue cuts during germ band extension

Laser ablations through several cells at the dorsolateral surface of wild type embryos during germ band extension to show evidence of tissue compression.

The imaging data for the tissue cuts experiments is available on Zenodo at doi:[10.5281/zenodo.15876646](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15876646).
