# Experiments

## Dl[RevF10],Ser[RX82]

- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition99** → X total / 15 normal / 10 weak / 15 strong / 3 CF / 11 bad / Batch was not ideal and the defective CFs do not seem to be associated with the mutation. Embryos with strong phenotype do not show CF defects, but can't say for sure the morphology is normal.

## tsg[2]

- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition77** → 55 total / 26 normal / 8 homozygous / 21 bad → Homozygous embryos are easily identified by major gastrulation defects with ectopic folds.

## noc[TE35B]

- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition72** → 76 total / 61 normal / 12 defects / 2 bad / 1 CF → Defective embryos had something wrong going in the furrow (ventral portion would not invaginate) but given the proportion it does not seem to be the consequence of homozygosity.

## btd[XA]

- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition79** → 86 (41) total / 28 normal / 13 CF / 45 bad → As expected I can identify the flies lacking cephalic furrow. There were many unfertilized eggs probably due to lack of males in the cage.

## wild type 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition37** → 104 total / 89 normal / 14 slightly different / 1 failed gastrulation

## slp[Δ34B] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition4** → embryos died (no oxygen under coverslip)
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition14** → 25 total / 14 normal / 10 CF / 1 bad
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition15** → 25 total / 2 CF / 2 late / 2 twist
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition16** → 23 total / 4 twist / 3 CF
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition17** → 60 total / 41 normal / 10 CF / 5 bad / 2 late / 1 twist
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition24** → 70 total / 63 normal / 7 abnormal / all embryos died!
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition26-27-28-29** → 60 total (more...) / oil dried out...
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition30-31-32** → 129 total / 84 normal / 41 CF / 4 bad / sounds about right proportion, some CF embryos were probably not CF per se (overestimated)
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition33-34** (chorion) → 15 total / 8 normal / 1 CF / 6 bad (2 possible CFs)
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition35-36** (chorion) → 85 total / 34 normal / 25 CF / 14 off / 8 old / 4 bad
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition80-81** → Software crashed.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition82** → 83 total / 57 normal / 19 CF HZ / 5 HZ / 2 bad → Homozygous embryos do have problems with the cephalic furrow. In most cases it is at least delayed and displaced anteriorly, and in a few embryos the furrow seems to be absent or in place.

## Tom[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition104** → 81 total / 27 normal / 14 ok / 39 die / 1 bad / Half of the embryos with a strong lethal phenotype. The embryo dismantles right after germ band extension. There seems to be no defects in the early furrow. The dorsal region of the furrow seems to be affected late, when the embryos is dismantling. Tom is an antagonist of Notch signaling and is highly expressed at the tip of the germ band.

## opa[8] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition39-40** (chorion) → 59 total / 30 normal / 15 CF defect / 8 dies / 6 bad / There are embryos with CF defects but it is unclear if they are the homozygote embryos. Found a couple of putative pair rule phenotypes but nothing conclusive.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition50** → Batch had a problem. All embryos with problems in the CF and germ band extension.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition51-53-54** → X total / X normal / X CF defect / X dies / X bad
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition61** → Similar to #50, all embryos had problems during gastrulation and germ band extension, very few looked normal. The older ones seemed better.

## spdo,tmod[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition101** → 83 total / 54 normal / 18 putative homozygotes / 7 CF defects / 4 bad / No apparent CF defects in the putative homozygotes. The CF defective flies are quite obvious, but there are only a few and might be unrelated to the deficiency.

## hh[AC] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition86** → 57 total / 21 normal / 12 die / 13 homozygous / 11 bad → No apparent CF defects in the homozygous embryos.

## Blimp-1[KG09531] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition93** → 89 total / 42 normal / 45 died / 2 bad / No apparent difference in the cephalic furrow formation. Dying embryos do not open the trachaea/

## salm[1] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition76** → 77 total / 58 normal / 15 bad / 4 CF → I could not identify any representative CF defect, only four embryos and seemed like a generic problem.

## mid[1] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition41-42** (chorion) → 96 total / 66 normal / 18 GBCF / 10 GB / 2 bad / Germ Band extension defects, ectopic furrows present.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition58** → 144 total / 69 normal / 33 CF / 42 bad / Phenotype is clear: germ band extension is abruptly stopped while ectopic furrows are formed in the surface.

## CG13894[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition87** → 76 total / 73 normal / 3 bad / No CF defects

## rau[f04153] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition103** → 66 total / 34 normal / 9 CF abnormal / 5 too old / 18 bad / The CF seems affected, but at this resolution it is hard to understand what is wrong. The invagination still forms but it is less prominent, so not a major defect. This allele is hypomorphic, would be interesting to image a deletion.

## wg[L8] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition55-56-57** → 58 normal / 28 mutant / 46 bad / No significant defects in the cephalic furrow.

## cnc[03921] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition69** → 54 total / 30 normal / 8 CF / 7 defect / 9 bad / Defective phenotypes are a bit variable but they do seem to affect the CF.

## EGFR[f2] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition100** → 66 total / 50 normal / 15 homozygous / 1 bad / CF is formed without delay in homozygous embryos and I can't identify any major defects. However, the embryos dies dramatically soon after the germ band extension. It is possible there are minor defects to the furrow formation that are hard to identify through the DIC.

## h[41] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition71** → 76 total / 49 normal / 22 homozygous / 4 defect / 1 bad / Homozygous embryos are clearly identifiable by the pair rule phenotype. There seems to be no alteration in the CF formation.

## stg[2] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition111 / BCV-BF-MultiPosition112** → 83 total / 32 normal / 16 mutants / 11 defective / 24 bad / Recording is split in two because the focus shifted midway through. Mutant embryos are relatively clear. Mitotic domains are not well resolved due to the optics but it is possible to see the expansions in the tissue, as well as the absence of these expansions in mutants. stg homozygous have visibly larger cells and the embryo deteriorates after germ band retraction and essentially falls apart.

## en[54] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition38** → batch is weird. Can't do a proper scoring of phenotypes.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition59** → I can identify embryos that gastrulate almost normal (CF and GB) but that fail to continue. None seem healthy... There are embryos where the CF is delayed and there are embryos where the CF is not formed. Some of the latter die completely (any cell movement stops). Can't conclude anything from this batch as well.

## tkv[4] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition64** → 94 normal / 10 GB / 4 bad / I found the following phenotypes so far, one where the furrow movements and cell divisions is abnormal, one with germ band extension defects, and the other where a narrow furrow forms more anteriorly. Not sure if any of these are the homozygous embryo.

## pxb[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition90** → 84 total / 55 normal / 19 posterior fold / 6 generalized defects / 2 CF defect / 2 bad / There were several embryos with a posterior fold similar to mid[1] mutants but no CF defects.

## upd1[C43] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition62** → total / 128 normal / 8 CF* / 8 bad / The only phenotype I could observe in a few embryos was a incipient posterior or mid body furrow that impaired germ band extension. I do not know if these are the homozygous embryos, but I suspect it is at least a subset of these, perhaps the most extreme phenotypes.

## numb[1] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition63** → There are embryos with germ band extension and CF defects. However, the phenotypes are somewhat variable and difficult to score.

## tal[KG01680] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition105** → 85 total / 21 normal / 64 strange / Not so obvious, there are some embryos that make it until the trachaea but most of them just fail before. It's hard to distinguish, so fail earlier and segments are not clear, some fail later and segments are visible.

## PIG-B[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition108** → 78 total / 53 normal / 10 defects / 10 CF / 5 bad / The phenotypes were variable and were hard to score. Not sure if the cephalic furrow defects were in homozygous embryos.

## slp1[1] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition66** → 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition67-68** → 73 total / 40 normal / 11 CF / 11 CF mild / 7 defects / 4 bad / There are embryos with CF absent and embryos with an incipient furrow (mild). I believe these are the mutant embryos.

## UAS-eve VALIUM10 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition43-44-45** → 33 total / 1 normal / 29 affected / 2 CF / 1 bad / Embryos do not show evident defects in the CF, although the morphology is not wild type. There is no clear pair rule phenotype, but there are segmentation defects visible late in development. This suggests eve is not being completely knockdown, or perhaps not early enough.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition46-47** → ~120 total / 43 normal / 2 affected / ~70 bad / Developing embryos looked normal... but embryos dried out too early. There were lots of unfertilized eggs.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition48-49** → 110 total / 62 normal / 47 bad / 1 CF / Also normal looking embryos. Something went wrong with the RNAi.

## dpn[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition88** → 64 total / 62 normal / 2 bad / No apparent CF defects

## crb[11A22] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition97** → 66 total / 43 normal / 19 homozygous / 2 failed / 2 bad / Embryos collapse during dorsal closure. No apparent CF defects.

## Dl[X] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition109** → 69 total / 27 normal / 11 almost normal / 22 mutants / 3 CF / 6 bad / There is a clear set of mutants that might display a small range of phenotypes. Weak ones that fail to reach the end of development and strong ones that get completely disorganized. A few display CF problems, but it seems many could have minor defects in the furrow if inspected at a higher resolution.

## rdx[03477] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition65** → 109 total / 43 normal / 49 CF / 17 bad → Several embryos that failed to form the cephalic furrow. The proportion seems out. This needs to be investigated further.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition78** → 86 total / 54 normal / 10 CF and die / 14 die / 2 df / 4 CF / 3 bad → Phenotypes vary but there are embryos that fail to form the CF and die.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition85** → 70 total / 32 normal / 20 die / 14 CF / 4 bad → There are definitely embryos with CF defects and the proportion is in range. However, the CF phenotypes are a bit variable.

## path[KG06640] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition95** → 73 total / 44 normal / 17 failed / 5 defects / 4 CF / 3 bad / There were a few with defective cephalic furrow, but not in the expected frequency. The homozygous embryos seem to fail to reach the end of embryogenesis and hatch, but their CF forms as usual.

## bowl[1] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition91** → 54 total / 44 normal / 6 anterior CF / 3 defective / 1 bad / Nothing very obvious, some embryos had a cephalic furrow that seemed slightly shifted but can't be fully sure.

## UAS-notch 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition96** → 58 total / 25 normal / 26 weak / 6 strong / 1 bad / No defects in the CF. Most distinguishable phenotype was the absence of denticles in the cuticle and some embryos did not develop.

## eve[3] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition60** → 140 total / 79 normal / 43 CF / 18 bad / 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition73** → 33 total / 26 normal / 7 CF / CF is absent, I cannot identify a delayed furrow being formed.

## UAS-delta 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition98** → 26 total / 7 normal / 1 failed / 18 bad / No phenotype at all...

## odd[5] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition22-23** → 76 total / 56 normal / 11 mutants / 8 not sure / 1 bad / There are a few pair rule phenotypes where the cephalic furrow is formed normally.

## rpr[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition107** → 81 total / 50 normal / 28 defective / 3 bad / Putative homozygotes do not develop completely. Head introgression is abnormal and slower, and trachaea are not formed. There are no cephalic furrow defects.

## trn[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition89** → 85 total / 81 normal CF / 4 bad / No apparent CF defects. Late mutant embryos had tracheal defects, but I did not count them.

## sob[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition106** → 77 total / 34 normal / 16 die before trachaea / 23 defective head involution / 4 bad / There were many embryos with problems, almost none completely wild type. I scored as normal the ones that reached the opening of the trachaea looking relatively healthy. Many die before the head involution and I assume these are homozygotes. No problems with the CF.

## kn[col1] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition70** → 70 normal / 4 defects / 2 CF / CF phenotypes here are a strong posterior shift in the furrow closer to the dorsal region in a way that the furrow line bends quite acutely. Not sure if phenotype is on homozygous embryos, though.

## aay[S042314] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition75** → 82 total / 76 normal / 5 defects / 1 bad / No phenotype.

## kni,knrl[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition94** → 75 total / 42 normal / 12 mutants / 21 bad / CF forms in homozygous embryos but its ventral portion does not moves anteriorly as in the wild type embryos. Instead it goes posterior on the opposite direction. Interestingly, in the mutants there is an ectopic dorsal fold forming just posterior to the CF.

## run[3] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition21** → No flies with obvious CF defects. Some embryos seem to have a shallow cephalic furrow.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition83-84** → 78 total / 34 normal / 11 slow / 28 putative hz / 5 bad → There does not seem to be a correlation between defective embryogenesis (putative homozygote embryos) and any furrow defect. Some embryos do have shallower furrows, but that is not consistent with the visual phenotype.

## bmm[Df] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition92** → 74 total / 46 normal / 21 defective / 5 CF defect / 2 bad / Severe gastrulation defects post germ band extension, specially at the anterior end. Many genes are deleted in this deficiency, so it is expected that development goes wrong. Yet, the cephalic furrow still forms at the standard position and timing. In some mutant embryos the CF might have been displaced anteriorly, but it does not look consistent across embryos.

## gt[X11] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition74** → 89 total / 65 normal / 19 CF / 5 df → Cephalic furrow is incipient or not formed. Embryos with cephalic furrow defects are likely homozygous.

## prd[4] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition11** → 20 total / 13 normal / 4 twist / 2 CF / 1 bad
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition12** → 20 total / 18 normal / 1 twist / 1 CF
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition19** → 49 total (43 and 51 were duplicates) / too many abnormal embryos! Germ band extension failed midway and there were very few wt phenotypes.
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition20** → 40 total / 28 normal / 6 CF / 5 late / 1 twist

## ovo[D1rv23] 
- **BCV-BF-MultiPosition102** → 82 total / 68 normal / 12 CF / 2 bad / CF embryos have a incipient furrow or displaced anteriorly, but in general the furrow does not show any apparent defects and these embryos might simply be variation.
