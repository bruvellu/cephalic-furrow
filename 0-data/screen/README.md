# Cephalic furrow mutant screen

We compiled a list of candidate genes potentially involved in cephalic furrow formation based on known genetic interactions and expression data at the head--trunk boundary.
For the screen, we obtained stocks carrying loss of function alleles of the candidate genes and imaged batches of embryos under DIC microscopy for 24h and scored for cephalic furrow defects.
