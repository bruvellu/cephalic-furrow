# Consider folder holding multiple folders 'data_layer_m*' and 'data_layer_p*',
# each having (somewhere deep inside in nested folders) a time-lapse sequence
# of 2D images. The user is assumed to choose two such 'data_layer_*' folders
# and this script will iterate between them considering every single one as a
# z-slice of some future stack. But since inside them are time-lapse sequences
# of images, the output is also a time-lapse sequence of stacks of these images:
# for every time point T take every folder F from the respective 'data_layer_*'
# folders and create a stack from slices/images "$F/$subPath/cmp_1_1_T$T.tif"

# Usage:
# 	- Run Fiji
#	- Run this script
#	- Choose the input folders and ranges
#	- Choose an output folder
