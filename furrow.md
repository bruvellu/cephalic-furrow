# Abstract


# Background

The head-trunk boundary is an ancient and essential trait for the evolution of
bilaterians.

The head-trunk boundary in Drosophila is demarcated by a deep, but transient,
invagination formed during gastrulation, known as the cephalic furrow.

Despite being a prominent trait, the development of the cephalic furrow remains
poorly understood compared to the other gastrulation movements in Drosophila.

We know relatively little about the genetic interactions that specify this
boundary, about the molecules involved in downstream signaling, and about the
morphogenetic processes involved.

In addition, the role that the cephalic furrow might play during gastrulation
remains a mystery.

Here, we investigate genes involved in the development of the cephalic furrow,
to better understand the interplay between molecular patterning and
morphogenesis of the head-trunk boundary in Drosophila.

Using multiplexed in situ hybridization, we resolve the spatial localization
between known and newly identified cephalic furrow genes, and how this
molecular arrangement is disrupted in mutant embryos.

Then we investigate the impact of mis-specification to the morphogenesis of the
cephalic furrow by analysing mutant embryos under high temporal resolution
using lightsheet microscopy.

The data reveals that normal cephalic furrow formation requires the coordinated
specification of both initiator cells and neighbouring cells.

The interplay between molecular patterning and tissue morphogenesis suggests
that the cephalic furrow has a buffering role alleviating the tissue tensions
during Drosophila gastrulation.
