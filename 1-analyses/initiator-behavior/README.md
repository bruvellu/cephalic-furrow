# Analysis of initiator cell behavior in cephalic furrow mutants

We observed differences in the behavior of initiator cells between *prd*, *btd*, and *eve* mutants.

- wildtype embryos show cell shortening and anisotropic apical constriction.
- *prd* embryos show both cell shortening and apical constriction but delayed.
- *btd* embryos only show a delayed reminiscent behavior of apical constriction.
- *eve* embryos show no cell shortening or apical constriction.

## Profile view

Crop of the initiator cell region from dorsal recordings from the onset of gastrulation to the formation of mitotic domains.

## Surface view

Crop of the initiator cell region from cartographic projections of lateral recordings after gastrulation.
