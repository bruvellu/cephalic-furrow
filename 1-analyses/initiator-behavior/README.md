A. Lateral views (only head?) for wt, btd and eve stacked vertically on the
   left. A square outline showing the region of initiator cell behavior.

B. Cartographic projection of the highlighted region. Sequence of
   representative frames (~4). Include row of color-coded cell area.

C. Dorsal view of invagination as in the current figure 2. Consider if this
