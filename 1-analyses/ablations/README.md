# Laser ablations around the cephalic furrow

Movies were obtained in a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal spinning disk, an EMCCD
camera (Andor iXon DU-888), a 60Ã— 1.2 NA water immersion objective, and the
software AndorIQ for image acquisition. The time resolution was set in 200 ms
and pixel size was 0.180556 um. 

Embryos were mounted laterally on MatTek glass-bottom Petri dishes and covered
in water. Experiments were performed under temperature control at 28 degrees
Celsius. 

For laser ablations, a Titanium Sapphire Chameleon Ultra II (Coherent) laser at
800 nm was tuned down from 80 MHz to 20 kHz using a pulse-picker. Laser power
measured before microscope port was 6 mW and pixel dwell time for scanning was
2 us. Each scan was repeated 10 consecutive times to make a cut along a single
cell. Embryos were ablated just once each.

For analysis, kymographs were obtained using a Fiji Plugin
(https://github.com/fiji/Multi_Kymograph) on cell edges in the direction
perpendicular to the cuts. The Kymographs were binarised and distance between
edges versus time was linearly fitted to obtain the recoil velocity.
