# Laser ablations around the cephalic furrow

## Analysis

Previous observations and our experiments indicate that the cephalic furrow formation is autonomous and driven by intrinsic forces generated by the initiator cells.
If thatâ€™s the case, we expect an active pull force from the invagination in the surrounding tissues.
To verify and quantify this force, we cut the apical membranes of cells and estimated the local tension by measuring the recoil velocity.

## Directories

- [`0-data`](0-data): Original recordings of [ablation](../../0-data/ablation) datasets.
- [`1-kymographs`](1-kymographs): Kymographs used to estimate tension.
- [`2-example`](2-example): Example dataset with linear fittings of kymograph data.
- [`3-plots`](3-plots): Plots with the recoil velocity.

## Workflow

1. Open ablation dataset in Fiji.
2. Create a line crossing the cell edges positioned perpendicular to the cut.
3. Generate a kymograph using the *Multi Kymograph* plugin.
4. Binarize the kymograph removing noise between edges.
5. Measure the inner distance between cell edges over time.
6. Perform a linear fit to obtain the recoil velocity.
7. Import velocity data to R and plot using [ablation.Rmd](ablation.Rmd).
