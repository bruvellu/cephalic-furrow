# Montage of fold profiles

The goal is showing the fold profile over time to compare the cephalic furrow with the ectopic folds.
Stacks are not synchronized between embryos.

1. Take the trace files
2. Invert to white background
3. Crop square as close as possible (530px)
4. Subset only frames with a trace
5. Make montage with 10 columns (adjust increment accordingly)
