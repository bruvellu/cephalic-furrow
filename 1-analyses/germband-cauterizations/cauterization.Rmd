## Wild type analysis

We have evidence that the germ band compresses the head-trunk interface and
causes tissue buckling. This led to the hypothesis the germ band is also
pushing the cephalic furrow invagination in normal conditions. We cauterized
the posterodorsal portion of wild type (Gap43 and heterozygotes) embryos to
block the germ band from elongating.

We measured the length of the cephalic furrow invagination in both conditions
and found the cauterized have 10% shorter invagination in average. It is
unclear if the difference is significant or not. There is also a weak
correlation between furrow length and amount of germ band extension. But this
also needs further analysis.

Factors that might be contributing to variation are the position of the frontal
slice, either more dorsal or more ventral will have an impact in the depth of
the furrow. The invagination on a dorsal slice will appear shorter since it is
only cutting the invagination tangentially. A more ventral cut, closer to the
mid section of the embryo will capture the actual length of the furrow. The
differences we see in our embryos could be due the slice position in the
dorsoventral axis.

Another aspect to consider is the partial block of the germ band extension.
There is at least one embryo that seems to show that, where the germ band is
only blocked on the surface and unevenly. The germ band actually dives into the
yolk. The cephalic furrow invaginations have unequal lengths accordingly.

## Mutant analysis

We also tested whether the germ band could be compressing the head-trunk tissue
and causing the ectopic buckling. We have a lightsheet dataset convincingly
suggesting that and repeated the experiments in the confocal. Due to
limitations of the system, we can only acquire one surface slice and a mid
section slice.

Unfortunately with a single slice it is more difficult to see the ectopic folds
in homozygous embryos. We have only a single uncauterized homozygous for btd
and eve and, while it is possible to see the rugging of the epithelium, the
folds are not completely clear. This makes the comparison to the cauterized
embryos less obvious. Nevertheless there are differences between the
conditions.

Interestingly, one of the cauterized eve homozygous embryo shows a clear
ectopic fold, even more obvious than controls. At first I thought the blocking
was not preventing the ectopic folding entirely, but looking more carefully, in
fact the germ band extension was not blocked evenly. One side actually pushes
the trunk tissue and that corresponds to the side where the large ectopic fold
is formed. I performed a PIV analysis to visualize the flows and one can
clearly see the tissue remains static as a block which could be the reason a
fold is formed there with the displacement of the head tissues.
