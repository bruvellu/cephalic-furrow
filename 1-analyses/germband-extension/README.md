# Germ band extension analyses

We want to know at which percentage of germ band extension and how long after
the onset of gastrulation the ectopic folds appear. For that we used landmarks
to measure the position of the germ band at the initial infolding/buckling and
at its deepest point. Read the details at [germband.Rmd](germband.Rmd).
