# Analyses

Overview of the different analyses we performed.

- [`germband-extension`](germband-extension): Characterization of the timing and percentage of germ band extension relative to the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants.
- [`ectopic-variability`](ectopic-variability): Analysis of the variability of ectopic fold formation in cephalic furrow mutants.
- [`folded-area`](folded-area): Analysis of the surface area folded in the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds.
- [`fold-depth`](fold-depth): Measurements of the maximum depth of the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds.

- [`initiator-behavior`](initiator-behavior): Analysis of the initiator cell behaviors in different genetic backgrounds.

- [`ablations`](ablations): Laser ablations to measure tension around the cephalic furrow neighborhood.
- [`cell-area-post-mitosis`](cell-area-post-mitosis): Quantification of the increase in apical area of individual cells in mitotic domains.
- [`fold-stats`](fold-stats): General statistics about the number and frequency of ectopic folds.
- [`germband-cauterizations`](germband-cauterizations): Tortuosity analysis of the blastoderm in cauterized cephalic furrow mutants, and measurements of the cephalic furrow depth in cauterized wildtype embryos.
- [`strain-rate`](strain-rate): Strain rate analysis in cephalic furrow mutants.
- [`tissue-flows`](tissue-flows): Analysis of tissue flows in cephalic furrow mutants.
- [`trunk-germ`](trunk-germ): Analysis of the tissue compression in the trunk--germ interface of cephalic furrow mutants.

- [`apical-area`](apical-area): Measurements of the apical cell area near mitotic domains.
