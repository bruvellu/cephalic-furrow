# Estimation of folded epithelial area

We estimated the epithelial area folded below the blastoderm surface in
cephalic furrow mutants.

Visually follow a cell to tell if it invaginated/buckled or not. Mark/track
only edge cells. Delimit the area with a ROI using the selection brush tool in
Fiji and measure the area. Correct the values for the projection and plot.
