# Estimation of folded epithelial area

We estimated the epithelial area folded below the blastoderm surface in
cephalic furrow mutants.

Visually follow a cell to tell if it invaginated/buckled or not. Delimit the
area with a ROI in Fiji and measure the area. Correct the values for the
projection and plot.
