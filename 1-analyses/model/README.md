# Cephalic furrow model

The code for the model and simulations is in a separate repository, currently at https://git.mpi-cbg.de/modeslab/cephalic_furrow (private).
Weâ€™ll soon make the code available in a public repository and deposit the manuscript version in Zenodo.
Sorry for the inconvenience!
