# Estimation of germ band speed

To better understand the relationship between ectopic folding and gastrulation movements, I want to test if the germ band speed might be a factor increasing the probability of ectopic folding. This could explain, for instance, the higher frequency of ectopic folds in wild type compared to mutant heterozygotes.
