# Split-GAL4 experiments

The goal of the split-GAL4 experiments is to block cephalic furrow formation by inhibiting myosin activity specifically in the initiator cells.

## Datasets

- `2024-01-29_btd+eve-GAL4xUAS-DNRho1_2_60s` (heterozygote): 80 embryos, 77 normal, 3 unfertilized. No cephalic furrow phenotype.
- `2024-08-29_L2_eve-btd-split-GAL4-homoz_vs_UAS-DNRho1.III_t3min_1` (homozygote): 100 embryos, 87 normal, 13 unfertilized. No cephalic furrow phenotype.
