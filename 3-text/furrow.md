# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila melanogaster* during gastrulation. Despite being a
prominent trait, the mechanisms and forces controlling the formation of the
cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we investigate the developmental role of
the cephalic furrow in the global context of gastrulation by live imaging
mutant embryos under lightsheet microscopy. We find that embryos lacking a
cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds in variable positions at the
head--trunk interface. We show the formation of ectopic folds is the result of
the concomitant epithelial expansion generated by mitotic domains, with the
compression driven by the germ band elongation. We propose the cephalic furrow
act as a buffer to these opposing tissue interactions by priming the position
of folding at the head--trunk boundary early in gastrulation.

# Introduction

<!--The head--trunk boundary is an ancient and essential trait for the evolution of bilaterians.-->

<!--The cephalic furrow background-->

The cephalic furrow is a prominent epithelial invagination that forms at the
head--trunk boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. Together with the
ventral furrow, the cephalic furrow is one of the first morphogenetic movements
in the embryo [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw]. It begins as lateral
indentations which quickly extend to the dorsal and ventral sides, and
invaginate deep into the yolk sac. Unlike the ventral furrow, however, the
invaginated cells do not give rise to any particular tissue, and the cephalic
furrow unfolds after a couple of hours of gastrulation. This prominent but
ephemeral existence makes the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic traits
of gastrulation.

<!--This process differs from other movements [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa]. -->

<!--This process remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Cephalic furrow patterning and morphogenesis-->

The cephalic furrow formation is genetically determined. It is regulated by the
zygotic expression of *buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*). The
overlap between *btd* expression in the head and *eve* stripe 1 is required to
the specification of the initiator cells [@Vincent1997-fa]. This thin row of
initiator cells undergo a coordinated series of cell shape changes, beginning
with cell shortening and followed by basal expansion. These cells sink below
the epithelial basal lamina and the surrounding tissues progressively
invaginate into the yolk [@Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi]. The position of
the cephalic furrow specified with incredible precision of 1% the embryo length
[@Liu2013-lc], and a mechanical coupling between epithelial cells ensures the
precision of the fold [@Eritano2020-mi]. These findings highlight the precise
genetic patterning in place coordinating the stereotypic formation of the
cephalic furrow in space and time.

<!--a patterning that can be achieved with only four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf]-->

<!--The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead* (*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve* embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination [@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow physical role-->

Despite increasing understanding of how the cephalic furrow forms, it is less
clear what developmental role this deep invagination plays during gastrulation.
Numerical approaches to understand the global gastrulation dynamics suggest the
cephalic furrow plays a global role to the complex morphogenetic movements of
gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb; @Dicko2017-wz]. The cephalic furrow can act as a
barrier to the tissue flows and has a global effect in orienting the germ band
extension towards the posterior [@Dicko2017-wz]. However, the interactions of
the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not been
investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac], and its physical role in the global
dynamics of *Drosophila* gastrulation remains poorly understood.

<!--A tissue fold can put epithelial cells in close contact and initiate cell-to-cell communication important for the patterning of blastoderm cells, but so far there is no evidence.-->

<!--Approach of this study-->

To investigate this question, we analyzed how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary and
the global gastrulation dynamics using live-imaging and laser cauterizations in
cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Summary of findings-->

We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow form late
ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ from the
cephalic furrow in timing, formation dynamics, folded area, and morphology. The
number and position of ectopic folds across the anteroposterior axis varies
between individual mutant embryos. We show the timing and position of ectopic
folds correlates with the formation of mitotic domains, suggesting that local
tissue interactions are causing the tissue to buckle. These local interactions,
however, are not sufficient to generate ectopic folds. Using laser
cauterizations to mechanically block the germ band extension, we show the
occurrence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary depends on the global
tissue compression caused by the germ band extension, and that this interaction
also contributes to the cephalic furrow formation in normal embryogenesis.

Our analyses reveal the head--trunk boundary is a convergent zone of tissue
interactions during gastrulation being orchestrated by two morphogenetic
events, the mitotic domains causing the expansion of head tissues, and the germ
band causing the compression of trunk tissues. Without the formation of the
cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary will
inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably. Thus, we propose the
cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming
the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains
part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the
head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about
the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating
morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.

# Results

<!--## Cephalic furrow mutants form variable ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary-->

<!--Context for late folds in CF mutants-->

We studied cephalic furrow mutants to understand how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impact the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary during
gastrulation. In *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos, the cephalic furrow fails to
invaginate and is entirely absent, but a late fold appears in the cephalic
region of *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa]. To understand the origin of this
late fold and verify if they also form in *btd* mutants, we generated flies
with a fluorescent background and the loss-of-function alleles for *btd* or
*eve*. We then acquired *in toto* live imaging data of mutant embryos using
lightsheet microscopy, and analyzed the pattern, dynamics, and variability of
folding events compared to the cephalic furrow formation. 

<!--TODO: Tissue flow analyses without CF-->

We analyzed the tissue flows in cephalic furrow mutants (homozygotes) in
comparison to sibling controls (heterozygotes) using PIV analysis. In wild type
embryogenesis the region of the head--trunk boundary shows a characteristic
pattern at the onset of gastrulation (before germ band extension and mitotic
domains). There is a strong flow towards the ventral region at the lateral
epithelium due to the ventral furrow invagination, while the head tissues and
dorsal trunk tissues have no direction. Once the cephalic furrow initiates it
directs the flow towards ventral of the dorsal tissues and a clockwise flow
pattern in the head, with dorsal tissues moving posteriorly and ventrally while
ventral head tissues move anteriorly and dorsally. The center of the hurricane
sits at the ventral portion of the head region just anterior to the cephalic
furrow. In the absence of the cephalic furrow, the ventral flow is restricted
to more posterior trunk tissues, while head tissues show more variable
directions despite also flowing dorsally. We also observe shear effects to
epithelial cells in cephalic furrow mutants. Once gastrulation proceeds we
observe an increased flow and a stronger tissue flow towards the anterior due
to the germ band elongation. These analysis show the flow pattern is disrupted
in cephalic furrow mutants and the head--trunk boundary as a convergent zone.

<!--Late ectopic folds form in CF mutants-->

At later gastrulation stages we observe the presence of late folds in *eve*
mutants, and reveal that *btd* embryos also form late ectopic folds at the
head--trunk interface during gastrulation (@fig:ectopic). We first detect
ectopic folds late during gastrulation. While the cephalic furrow in wild type
embryos forms in stage 6, at the onset of gastrulation, the ectopic folds in
mutant embryos only appear in stage 8, when the germ band has already extended
at least a third of the embryo length ({@fig:ectopic}A, Video 1 and 2). Unlike
the stereotypic morphology of the cephalic furrow, the ectopic folds are often
asymmetric, have a looser cleft between edges, and lack the typical cell shapes
at the invagination tip and edges ({@fig:ectopic}B). Ectopic folds thus form
late and have irregular morphology.

<!--TODO: Figure with shape analysis of ectopic folds.-->

<!--Ectopic folds vary between individual mutant embryos-->

<!--Dynamics of ectopic folds is different from CF-->

We traced the formation of ectopic folds at the head--trunk epithelia to
analyze the dynamics, their position, and the area of folded tissue in ectopic
folds. The number of ectopic in mutants range from one to four on each side of
the embryos, and that mutants without ectopic folds were rare (Table X). The
cephalic furrow initiates as a straight orthogonal line whose dorsal portion
progressively shifts to the posterior, while its ventral portion shifts to the
anterior, the invagination extends to the dorsal and ventral sides bending the
initial straight line ({@fig:variability}A). In contrast, the ectopic folds
generally appear tilted with an angle (not orthogonal) to the anteroposterior
axis, they remain straight over time not bending, and they stay within the
lateral portion without extending as far dorsal or ventral as the cephalic
furrow ({@fig:variability}B,C). Thus, the dynamics of ectopic fold formation
differ from the canonical cephalic furrow formation.

<!--TODO: Measure angles and other quantitative measures from traces-->

We then analyzed the position of folding events along the head--trunk interface
and found it varies from embryo-to-embryo. We analyzed the distribution of
folding events between mutant embryos, and find the position of ectopic folds
vary compared to the position of the cephalic furrow formation on the lateral
blastoderm ({@fig:variability}I). The formation of ectopic folds can even
differ between the left and right side of the same embryo
({@fig:variability}J). Thus, in contrast to the predictable cephalic furrow,
the formation of ectopic folds varies from embryo to embryo.

<!--The ectopic folds, either in *btd* or in *eve* mutants, can occur near the canonical cephalic furrow region, but also occur in more anterior or more posterior positions.-->

<!--This variability is in stark contrast to the stereotypic formation of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis, suggesting the process of ectopic fold formation might be driven by stochastic events and mechanical forces in the epithelial tissue.-->

<!--TODO: Table with main annotated datasets-->

<!--Ectopic folds appear next to mitotic domains-->

We found a correlation between the ectopic folds and mitotic domains
(MD)---groups of blastoderm cells that divide in synchrony [@Foe1989-cw].
Ectopic folds in mutant embryos form next to or in between mitotic domains
(@fig:mitotic). A common position for the formation of ectopic folds is near
the canonical place of the cephalic furrow formation. In *btd* embryos this
ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD7 (*btd* mutants lack MD2
[@Edgar1994-pi]). In *eve* embryos this ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD2
(*eve* mutants have an expanded MD2 [@Vincent1997-fa]). Ectopic folds also form
at a more anterior position, between between MD1 and MD9/MD5 in both *btd* and
*eve* mutants. The posterior-most ectopic fold we detect forms posterior to MD6
({@fig:mitotic}A--C). More rarely *btd* embryos form a shallower fold between
MD7 and MD6. Thus, these observations indicate the position of ectopic folds is
variable but not random; they are in most cases associated with the mitotic
domains.

<!--Ectopic folding coincides with area expansion of dividing cells-->
<!--Ectopic folds form by tissue buckling rather than invagination-->

The timing of ectopic folding also coincides with mitotic domains. We analyzed
the apical area of cells during ectopic fold formation. The apices of the
epithelial cells about to fold inwards are compressed progressively by the
apical expansion of dividing cells in the adjacent mitotic domains
({@fig:mitotic}D). The expansion of dividing cells thus always precede the
formation of the ectopic folds, and they form by abrupt buckling of the tissue
instead of the progressive invagination characteristic of the cephalic furrow
({@fig:mitotic}E). Thus, we find the formation of ectopic folds only occurs
after the epithelial compression caused by the apical expansion of mitotic
cells. Also the dynamics of the process is rather different than the cephalic
furrow, even though the end result---an epithelial fold---might appear similar.

<!--TODO: Quantify the apical area for ectopic fold surroundings-->

<!--TODO: Panel showing apical area upon ectopic fold formation-->

<!--The only exception occurs in the canonical cephalic furrow position of *btd* embryos where we detect the narrowing of apical cell area before expansion of adjacent mitotic domains (see @slppaper), although the tissue only folds when the cells in adjacent mitotic domains undergo area expansion during mitosis.-->

<!--Concluding mitotic coincidence and buckling-->

<!--We thus find a correlation in space and time between the formation of mitotic domains and ectopic folds. This tissue dynamics and the cell shape analysis indicate that local mechanical forces in the tissue play a role in ectopic fold formation in *btd* and *eve* mutants.-->

<!--Ectopic folding area and depth smaller than CF invagination-->

Finally, we estimated the area of epithelial tissue inside the ectopic folds.
We first projected the surface of the embryo as a flat plane, backtracked
the infolded cells of individual ectopic folds of mutant embryos, and
demarcated the folded region on the blastoderm before gastrulation
({@fig:variability}D--F). We measured the area of individual ectopic folds and
the total folded area per embryo. We find that both ectopic folds and the total
area of folded tissue per embryo in *btd* and *eve* mutants is roughly half
that of the invaginated area of the cephalic furrow in sibling controls
({@fig:variability}G). We have also directly measured the depth of ectopic
folds in frontal view datasets, and obtained the same result that ectopic folds
are shallower than the cephalic furrow invagination ({@fig:variability}H). The
amount of tissue in ectopic folds is smaller than in the cephalic furrow of
wild type embryos.

<!--TODO: We observe that individual mutant embryos can have the same total invaginated area either having one deep fold or two shallower folds.-->

<!--Concluding differentness of ectopic folds-->

Overall, we find that embryos lacking the cephalic furrow form late ectopic
folds. The formation of ectopic folds is different from the cephalic furrow in
terms of number, position, dynamics and area. Importantly, ectopic fold
formation is variable across embryos, in contrast to the stereotypic cephalic
furrow formation in sibling controls and wild type. These analyses indicate the
formation of ectopic folds is driven by different developmental mechanisms than
the cephalic furrow, possibly influenced by stochastic events and mechanical
forces in the epithelial tissue.

<!--TODO: Analyses of tissue flow in the absence of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--We analyzed the tissue flow in cephalic furrow mutants using particle image velocimetry. We find that without the cephalic furrow the head--trunk boundary region remains static against the movement of the trunk tissues.-->

<!--## Ectopic folds form next to mitotic domains-->


<!--## Tissue compression generated by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--## Ectopic fold formation is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by the germ band extension-->

<!--## Concomitant expansion of head tissues by the mitotic domains and compression of trunk tissues by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--Double mutants without mitotic domains and cephalic furrow-->

To test whether the tissue expansion generated by mitotic domains play a role
in the formation of ectopic folds, we generated double mutant embryos lacking
the cephalic furrow and the mitotic domains. We combined our fluorescent lines
carrying the loss of function alleles for *btd* and *eve* with a loss of
function allele for *stg*, a gene that regulates the formation of mitotic
domains in the nuclear cycle 14 [@Edgar1989-hv]. We then imaged *stg*--*btd*
and *stg*--*eve* double mutants using our lightsheet pipeline as before.

**[Hypothetical outcome]** We find the ectopic folds are still present in
double mutant embryos which lack mitotic domains (@fig:double). We observe,
however, a different distribution of folding events when compared to the single
mutant embryos. This indicates that mitotic domains are not required but bias
the position and formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants, the ectopic folds are absent, suggesting the presence of mitotic domains is necessary for the formation of ectopic folds. This indicates they play a key role in the balance of local forces that lead to the formation of ectopic folds. -->

<!--Cauterization experiment to test germ band influence-->

The presence of ectopic folds in double mutants indicate that other mechanical
forces acting during gastrulation are driving the formation of ectopic folds at
the head--trunk interface. Our data on tissue flows and the formation of
ectopic fold posterior to MD6 against compressed epithelial cells in the dorsal
trunk region (Figure x), suggested the germ band extension could driving the
formation of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary in the absence of the
cephalic furrow. We thus tested this hypothesis by mechanically blocking the
germ band from extending in *btd* and *eve* mutants by cauterizing the
blastoderm tissue to the vitelline envelope, and by analyzing the epithelial
morphology (@fig:mutcauts).

<!--Blocking the germ band extension suppresses ectopic folds-->

Cauterized the mutant embryos show no ectopic folds at the head--trunk
boundary. In contrast to non-cauterized embryos, cauterized embryos show a
regular epithelium outline without deformations ({@fig:mutcauts}A,D,E). The
main tissue movements are driven by the mitotic domains which are still present
({@fig:mutcauts}A). The dividing cells still expand their apical area and
compress the non-dividing surrounding cells in cauterized mutant embryos.
However, this compression is insufficient to cause the tissue to buckle
({@fig:mutcauts}B,C and Video X). Thus, the germ band extension is required for
the formation of ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants.

<!--TODO: Measure epithelial straightness in cauterization experiments-->

<!--TODO: Estimate the expansion of head tissues in cauterized embryo-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

These experiments show the main driving force for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants comes from the global compression of trunk
tissues caused by the elongating germ band. When mitotic domains are present,
the dividing cells increase the local tissue interactions creating areas prone
to buckling, which bias the formation of ectopic folds. However, the germ band
extension is what drives the formation of ectopic folds.

## Local tissue strain and global stiffness modulate ectopic folding

**[Hypothetical outcome]** To complement our in vivo observations and
understand the interplay between local and global tissue interactions, we
developed a 1D linear model that represents the epithelium of a gastrulating
embryo. We adapted a previous model and reached the set of parameters that
reproduced epithelial behavior in different conditions in vivo. We first tested
whether local tissue strain generated by mitotic expansion would cause ectopic
folds and found it does. However, the formation of ectopic folds depend on
global stiffness of the tissue, and below a certain threshold no ectopic folds
form (Figure X).

# Discussion

<!--General introduction to cephalic furrow topic-->

The cephalic furrow remains the least understood morphogenetic movements of
*Drosophila* gastrulation. Its transient nature makes the cephalic furrow
particularly challenging to investigate, and partly the reason why only a few
mutants have been identified. Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be
able to investigate the cephalic furrow formation.

<!--The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone-->

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is a convergent zone of
tissue flow during gastrulation. In early stages the relatively static head
tissues contrast with the ventral-moving trunk tissues. In wild type this
ventral flow is directed and enhanced by the active pull from the cephalic
furrow, while in mutants the flow more variable and restricted more
posteriorly. A similar flow has been predicted numerically where the formation
of the cephalic furrow would direct the tissue flows of the entire embryo
[@ref]. That is what we observe in vivo in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Late forces lead to epithelial instability-->

In late stages we observe a strong influence from the germ band extension at
the head--trunk boundary via tissue compression. At the same time, the mitotic
domains cause an expansion of the head tissues. In the absence of the cephalic
furrow, these events coincide with the formation of stochastic ectopic folds at
the head--trunk interface. Although presence of late folds was known [@ref],
their origin was uncertain. Our analyses suggest that mechanical rather than
genetic forces underlie the instability in the monolayer epithelia which leads
to tissue buckling.

<!--Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains-->

The influence of mitotic forces in adjacent cells is being investigated
[@ref]. They have been shown to exert forces during expansion [@ref], and
associated with the formation of ectopic folds by creating an imbalance of
forces in contractile tissues [@ref]. We find the expansion of mitotic domains
indeed influences the stability of adjacent tissues. The formation of ectopic
folds largely occur next to mitotic domains. We find by our in vivo experiments
and in silico models however that the buckling only occurs when the tissue is
more fluid adjacent to a stiffer region.

<!--TODO: Discussion tissue fluidity here?-->

<!--Germ band elongation is required for ectopic folds-->

This reveals the germ band extension as the driving force underlying the
ectopic epithelial folding. Our cauterization experiments show the germ band
extension causes epithelial compression at the head--trunk boundary. This shows
evidence of the long range global impact the germ band extension exerts during
gastrulation. Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation where
the extension of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk interface.

<!--Possible CF interactions in normal embryogenesis-->

The interactions of the cephalic furrow with other morphogenetic movements are
not well studied. Our data reveals evidence that the germ band could have a
role in the cephalic furrow formation during normal embryogenesis while pushing
the tissue deeper in the yolk, similar to what has been described for ventral
furrow [@ref]. Thus suggesting a global interaction between morphogenetic
movements in gastrulation.

<!--Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position-->

Therefore, the role that the cephalic furrow appears to accomplish during
gastrulation is to anticipate these conflicts and prime, in a predictable
manner, the position that the tissue will fold. In doing so, the cephalic
furrow would prevent potential defects associated with erratic buckling, such
as the compromise of cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling in the
epithelia, and thus ensure a stereotypical balance of forces required for the
precise patterning of embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary,
to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic
furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow
accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ
band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable
invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus
preventing erratic epithelial buckling.

<!--## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes-->

<!--The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.-->

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process. That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process caused by the germ band was not.-->

<!--Overall, our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.-->

<!--## Conclusions-->

<!--Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila. The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.-->
