# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. Despite being a prominent
embryonic landmark, the role of the cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we
investigate how defects in cephalic furrow formation impact gastrulation
dynamics by live-imaging mutant embryos under lightsheet microscopy. We observe
that when the cephalic furrow is absent, the tissues at the head--trunk
interface become uneven and form erratic epithelial folds. We show these
ectopic folds are the result of mechanical pressure between head and trunk
tissues, generated by the concomitant expansion of mitotic domains in the head
and extension of the germ band in the trunk. We thus propose that, by priming
the position of folding and storing epithelia out-of-plane, the cephalic furrow
counteracts and buffers these opposing physical interactions preventing
epithelial instability at the head--trunk boundary during gastrulation.

# Introduction

<!--Gastrulation is a fundamental event in animal development-->
Gastrulation is a key moment in development. Some animals do it simply, others
have an elaborate orchestration of tissue movements. The fly *Drosophila
melanogaster* has a derived and complex gastrulation process with several
concomitant invaginations, cell and morphogenetic processes, and tissue flows
across the embryo [@RefFlyGastrulation].
<!--Fly gastrulation is highly derived, complex and fascinating-->

<!--Invaginations and movements are well-understood-->
When Drosophila embryos gastrulate, a ventral invagination segregates
mesodermal tissues and gives rise to muscles, anterior and posterior
invaginations give rise to the foregut and hindgut at both ends of the
digestive tube, and the germ band extension quickly performs the axis
elongation of the embryo. Among these processes, however, there is one whose
function remains mysterious despite its prominent position in the embryo---the
cephalic furrow.
<!--Except for the cephalic furrow which remains mysterious-->

<!--Other movements have a clear role; the cephalic furrow not so.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow is an early and deep invagination-->
The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that forms in the gastrulating
*Drosophila* embryo. It is one of the first morphogenetic movements in the
embryo initiating at the onset of gastrulation together with the ventral
furrow. The cephalic furrow begins as lateral indentations that invaginate deep
into the yolk sac, extending completely to the dorsal and ventral sides in a
matter of minutes [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw]. The structure demarcates
a major landmark in the embryo, the position between the procephalon and the
germ band, or in other words, the head--trunk boundary of *Drosophila*.
<!--Demarcates a significant morphological landmark in the embryo-->

<!--Cephalic furrow formation is stereotypic and controlled genetically-->
Cephalic furrow formation is controlled genetically. This position is specified
by the zygotic expression of *buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*)
stripe 1 [@Vincent1997-fa], with 1% accuracy along the body length
[@Liu2013-lc]. The specified initiator cells then undergo a coordinated series
of cell shape changes [@Spencer2015-td] driven by lateral myosin contractility
[@Eritano2020-mi], which triggers the infolding of epithelial cells below the
basal lamina, while mechanical coupling mechanisms between epithelial cells
ensure the precision of the fold. Thus, flies evolved precise developmental
mechanisms in place to initiate and drive cephalic furrow formation at the
onset of gastrulation.
<!--Developmental mechanisms are in place for formation-->

<!--Enigmatic because transient and leaves no trace-->
Despite the patterning and morphogenesis being under genetic control, and
demarcating a significant anatomical landmark of the body, the role of the
cephalic furrow remains enigmatic. Unlike the ventral furrow, the invaginated
cells of the cephalic furrow do not give rise to any particular tissue in the
embryo. More intriguingly, the cephalic furrow is transient and unfolds and
vanishes entirely after gastrulation leaving no morphological traces
[@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa]. This raises the question whether the
cephalic furrow might play a physical role during gastrulation.
<!--Might have a physical rather than regulatory role-->

<!--Approach of this study-->
Here we investigate this hypothesis by analyzing how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impact the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary and
the global dynamics of gastrulation.

<!--Summary of findings-->
We find that when the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, the epithelia at the
head--trunk interface shows unpredictable deformations and buckling events. We
show the tissue buckling is the result of mechanical forces acting on the
monolayer epithelia and influenced by two key players, the expansion of apical
cell area by mitotic domains and the tissue compression by germ band extension.
These events create a convergent flow at the head--trunk boundary. Without the
formation of the cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the head--trunk
boundary inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably. During normal
embryogenesis, the genetically-determined cephalic furrow predictably
anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions and primes the position of
folding at the head--trunk boundary. The cephalic furrow invagination directs
tissue flow storing a significant amount of epithelial area thus preventing
epithelial instability. We thus propose the cephalic furrow acts as a temporary
buffer for the conflicting tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary
during gastrulation.

<!--Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--We used live-imaging and laser cauterizations in cephalic furrow mutants.-->

<!--Interestingly, in *eve* embryos where the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, a late fold appears in the cephalic region [@Vincent1997-fa]. The origin of this late fold is unclear whether it is a reminiscent of the cephalic furrow patterning or formed by other developmental mechanisms. Thus, the physical role in the global dynamics of *Drosophila* gastrulation remains poorly understood.-->

<!--This process remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Mutants for either *btd* or *eve* fail to initiate the cephalic furrow [@Vincent1997-fa]. -->

<!--a patterning that can be achieved with only four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf]-->

<!--The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead* (*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve* embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination [@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--A tissue fold can put epithelial cells in close contact and initiate cell-to-cell communication important for the patterning of blastoderm cells, but so far there is no evidence.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow is genetically-defined with a precise stereotypic timing and position. The invagination is large extending from dorsal to ventral and deep sinking almost the whole yolk invagination at an important anatomical landmark of the embryo, the head--trunk boundary. Yet, the cephalic furrow, unlike the ventral furrow, does not give rise to a particular cell fates and is transient, this massive structure progressively unfolds before germ band retraction. These features, being a major but transient structure make the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic morphogenetic movements in *Drosophila* gastrulation (@fig:headtrunk).-->

<!--Cephalic furrow directs convergent tissue flow preventing epithelial deformations at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ from the cephalic furrow in timing, formation dynamics, folded area, and morphology. The number and position of ectopic folds across the anteroposterior axis varies between individual mutant embryos. We show the timing and position of ectopic folds correlates with the formation of mitotic domains, suggesting that local tissue interactions are causing the tissue to buckle. These local interactions, however, are not sufficient to generate ectopic folds. Using laser cauterizations to mechanically block the germ band extension, we show the occurrence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary depends on the global tissue compression caused by the germ band extension, and that this interaction also contributes to the cephalic furrow formation in normal embryogenesis.-->

<!--Our analyses reveal the head--trunk boundary is a convergent zone of tissue interactions during gastrulation being orchestrated by two morphogenetic events, the mitotic domains causing the expansion of head tissues, and the germ band causing the compression of trunk tissues. Without the formation of the cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary will inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably. Thus, we propose the cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

# Results

<!--Live-imaging of cephalic furrow mutants to capture tissue dynamics-->

The formation of the cephalic furrow is a dynamic and transient process that
occurs within a short window of time during gastrulation. To understand how the
tissue dynamics at the head--trunk boundary is affected by the lack of the
cephalic furrow, we studied cephalic furrow mutants using live-imaging. We
generated fly strains containing the loss-of-function alleles *btd^XA* and
*eve^3* and the fluorescent membrane marker Gap43-mCherry, and imaged the
embryos using lightsheet microscopy under high-temporal resolution.

<!--Mutants show late ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary-->

In wild type embryos and sibling controls (i.e. *btd* and *eve* heterozygotes),
the cephalic furrow begins to invaginate in stage 6 and is fully invaginated by
stage 8 ({@fig:ectopic}A). In *btd* and *eve* mutants, the cephalic furrow
fails to initiate [@Vincent1997-fa], and no indentation is visible in stages 6
and 7a ({@fig:ectopic}A). In subsequent stages 7b and 8, however, we detect the
formation of epithelial folds at the head--trunk interface of *btd* and *eve*
mutants ({@fig:ectopic}A,C, Video 1). These late folds lack the stereotypic
cell morphologies, such as wedge-shaped apex cells, have a wider, often
asymmetric cleft, and are shallower compared to the cephalic furrow
({@fig:ectopic}B,D, Video 2). To understand the processes driving ectopic fold
formation in *btd* and *eve* mutants, and uncover their developmental origins,
we analyzed how the formation of ectopic folds compares to the cephalic furrow
formation.

<!--Ectopic fold shape, dynamics and size-->

<!--TODO: Include tortuosity of dorsal views around here-->

<!--TODO: How long does the cephalic and ectopic lasts (get numbers)-->

We traced the formation of ectopic folds at the head--trunk epithelia and
measured how their shape, angle, area, and position changed over time. The
number of ectopic folds on each side of the embryo varies between one and four,
and mutants without ectopic folds are rare (Table X). The dynamics of ectopic
fold formation differs from cephalic furrow formation. The cephalic furrow
forms as a straight line almost orthogonal to the anteroposterior axis, and
progressively tilts from ~80° to ~60°, and becomes curved in the first 15 min
after gastrulation ({@fig:dynamics}E,F). In contrast, ectopic folds form with
variable angles (between 80°--50°) and tortuosity values without any particular
trend ({@fig:dynamics}E,F). While controls show a consistent shift in angle,
btd shifts are more variable ({@fig:dynamics}H). Ectopic folds remain mostly
straight without extending as far dorsal or ventral, and unfold earlier
compared to the cephalic furrow (Video 3).

<!--TODO: Continue from here-->

We then estimated the area of folded epithelial tissue contained in ectopic
folds by backtracking the infolded cells in cartographic projections of our
recordings ({@fig:dynamics}D--F). We find the total area of folded tissue per
embryo in *btd* and *eve* mutants is roughly half of the total area of the
cephalic furrow invagination in sibling controls ({@fig:dynamics}G). These data
reveal significant differences between the dynamics and properties of ectopic
folds and the formation of the cephalic furrow, suggesting the two are formed
by distinct developmental mechanisms.

<!--TODO: Move to discussion-->
<!--The formation of ectopic folds might be a common effect for the lack of the cephalic furrow.-->
<!--These late ectopic folds have been observed in *eve* mutants but their developmental origin remained unclear [@Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--We observe that individual mutant embryos can have the same total invaginated area either having one deep fold or two shallower folds.-->

<!--The cephalic furrow initiates as a straight orthogonal line whose dorsal portion progressively shifts to the posterior, while its ventral portion shifts to the anterior, the invagination extends to the dorsal and ventral sides bending the initial straight line ({@fig:dynamics}A). -->

<!--When the germ band extended a third of the embryo length and the mitotic domains appear.-->

<!--Ectopic folds vary between individual mutant embryos-->

We then analyzed the distribution of folding events along the head--trunk
interface in mutants to verify if ectopic folds form in stereotypic locations.
We observe the position of ectopic folds varies between individual mutant
embryos ({@fig:dynamics}H), and can even differ between the left and right side
of the same embryo ({@fig:dynamics}J). This variability contrasts with the
stereotypic position of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis
[@Liu2013-lc], suggesting the process of ectopic fold formation might be
influenced by stochastic mechanical forces in the epithelia.

<!--Ectopic folds correlate with mitotic domains-->

Indeed, these folding events are not evenly distributed along the lateral
blastoderm ({@fig:mitotic}A). We find a correlation between the position of
ectopic folds and the mitotic domains (MD)---groups of blastoderm cells that
divide in synchrony [@Foe1989-cw]. In mutant embryos, the ectopic folds form
next to or in between mitotic domains ({@fig:mitotic}B,C). They can occur near
the canonical cephalic furrow position or in more anterior or more posterior
positions. In *btd* embryos, ectopic folds form near the cephalic furrow
position between MD5 and MD7 (*btd* embryos lack MD2 [@Edgar1994-pi]), at a
more anterior position between MD1 and MD9/MD5, and at the posterior side of
MD6 ({@fig:mitotic}A--C). More rarely, *btd* embryos form a shallower fold
between MD7 and MD6. *eve* embryos show a similar pattern of folding events
(*eve* mutants have an expanded MD2 [@Vincent1997-fa]). These observations
suggest the formation of ectopic folds is associated with the formation of
mitotic domains.

<!--Ectopic folding coincides with area expansion of dividing cells-->

We thus analyzed the tissue dynamics in more detail and find the timing of
ectopic folding coincides with the cell divisions in mitotic domains. The
epithelial cells about to fold inwards forming an ectopic fold are compressed
by the expansion of dividing cells in adjacent mitotic domains
({@fig:mitotic}D). This mitotic expansion always precede the formation of
ectopic folds. Additionally, the ectopic folding occurs by abrupt buckling of
the tissue instead of the progressive invagination characteristic of the
cephalic furrow ({@fig:mitotic}E, Video 4). These observations suggest the
local mechanical forces in the tissue play a role in the ectopic tissue
buckling that occurs in *btd* and *eve* mutants.

<!--The only exception occurs in the canonical cephalic furrow position of *btd* embryos where we detect the narrowing of apical cell area before expansion of adjacent mitotic domains (see @slppaper), although the tissue only folds when the cells in adjacent mitotic domains undergo area expansion during mitosis.-->

<!--Concluding differentness of ectopic folds-->

<!--We thus find that embryos lacking the cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds. The formation of ectopic folds is different from the cephalic furrow in terms of number, position, dynamics and area. Importantly, ectopic fold formation is variable across embryos, in contrast to the stereotypic cephalic furrow formation in sibling controls and wild type. These analyses indicate the formation of ectopic folds is driven by different developmental mechanisms than the cephalic furrow, possibly influenced by stochastic events and mechanical forces in the epithelial tissue.-->

<!--TODO: Analyses of tissue flow in the absence of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--We analyzed the tissue flow in cephalic furrow mutants using particle image velocimetry. We find that without the cephalic furrow the head--trunk boundary region remains static against the movement of the trunk tissues.-->

<!--## Ectopic folds form next to mitotic domains-->

<!--## Tissue compression generated by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--## Ectopic fold formation is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by the germ band extension-->

<!--## Concomitant expansion of head tissues by the mitotic domains and compression of trunk tissues by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--Double mutants without mitotic domains and cephalic furrow-->

To test whether the mitotic expansion plays a role in the formation of ectopic
folds, we generated double mutant embryos which lack the cephalic furrow and
the mitotic domains. We combined our fluorescent strains carrying the loss of
function alleles for *btd* and *eve* with a loss of function allele for *stg*,
a gene that regulates the formation of mitotic domains in the nuclear cycle 14
[@Edgar1989-hv]. We then imaged *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants
using our lightsheet pipeline.

**[hypothetical outcome]** We observe the formation of ectopic folds in double
mutant embryos (@fig:double). The distribution of folding events, however, is
different compared to the single mutant embryos (@fig:double). This indicates
the expanding cells in mitotic domains are not required for the formation of
ectopic folds, and that other mechanical forces acting during gastrulation must
be causing the tissue buckling at the head--trunk interface of *btd* and *eve*
mutants.

<!--TODO: Tissue flow analyses before MD-->

<!--We analyzed the tissue flows in cephalic furrow mutants in using PIV analysis. In wild type embryogenesis the region of the head--trunk boundary shows a characteristic pattern at the onset of gastrulation (before germ band extension and mitotic domains). There is a strong flow towards the ventral region at the lateral epithelium due to the ventral furrow invagination, while the head tissues and dorsal trunk tissues have no direction. Once the cephalic furrow initiates it directs the flow towards ventral of the dorsal tissues and a clockwise flow pattern in the head, with dorsal tissues moving posteriorly and ventrally while ventral head tissues move anteriorly and dorsally. The center of the hurricane sits at the ventral portion of the head region just anterior to the cephalic furrow. In the absence of the cephalic furrow, the ventral flow is restricted to more posterior trunk tissues, while head tissues show more variable directions despite also flowing dorsally. We also observe shear effects to epithelial cells in cephalic furrow mutants. Once gastrulation proceeds we observe an increased flow and a stronger tissue flow towards the anterior due to the germ band elongation. These analysis show the flow pattern is disrupted in cephalic furrow mutants and the head--trunk boundary as a convergent zone.-->

<!--Cauterization experiment to test germ band influence-->

Two observations led us to consider the germ band extension could driving the
formation of ectopic folds. First, a PIV analysis of gastrulation reveals the
head--trunk boundary is a convergent zone of tissue flow where tissues from the
head and from the trunk collide on the dorsal side driven by the mitotic
domains and germ band extension, respectively ({@fig:flows}). Second, the
observation of compressed epithelial cells on the dorsal trunk region against
the germ band where the formation of a ectopic fold posterior to MD6 occurs
({@fig:compressed}). To test this hypothesis we mechanically block the germ
band extension in *btd* and *eve* mutants by cauterizing the blastoderm tissue
to the vitelline envelope at the onset of gastrulation ({@fig:cauterization}A).

<!--Blocking the germ band extension suppresses ectopic folds-->

We find that when the germ band extension is blocked, the mutant embryos show
no ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary (Video 5). In contrast to the
folds present in the epithelium of *btd* and *eve* mutants, the epithelium in
cauterized embryos does not show folds and most cell apices are close to the
vitelline envelope ({@fig:cauterization}B,C, Video 6). We quantified the
deformations in the head--trunk epithelium from the onset of gastrulation
between non-cauterized and cauterized mutant embryos. We find the tortuosity of
the epithelium increases over time in non-cauterized mutants significantly more
than in cauterized mutants ({@fig:cauterization}D,E). The mitotic domains are
still present and compress the non-dividing cells at the head--trunk boundary
({@fig:cauterization}D), but this compression is insufficient to cause the
tissue to buckle ({@fig:cauterization}B,C). These experiments reveal the
driving force for the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants is
the compression of trunk tissues caused by the elongating germ band. 

<!--TODO: Estimate the expansion of head tissues in cauterized embryo-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

<!--When mitotic domains are present, the dividing cells generate areas prone to buckling, which bias the formation of ectopic folds. However, the germ band extension is what drives the formation of ectopic folds.-->

<!--Local tissue strain and global stiffness modulate ectopic folding-->

We tested how the mitotic strain might bias the position of folding and how the
mechanical force from the germ band leads to tissue buckling by developing a 1D
linear model. **[Hypothetical outcome]** To complement our in vivo observations
and understand the interplay between local and global tissue interactions, we
developed a 1D linear model that represents the epithelium of a gastrulating
embryo. We adapted a previous model and reached the set of parameters that
reproduced epithelial behavior in different conditions in vivo. We first tested
whether local tissue strain generated by mitotic expansion would cause ectopic
folds and found it does. However, the formation of ectopic folds depend on
global stiffness of the tissue, and below a certain threshold no ectopic folds
form (@fig:model).

# Discussion

<!--TODO: Physical in silico role of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--The physical role of the cephalic furrow has been investigated in silico. Numerical approaches suggest the cephalic furrow might play a global role to the complex morphogenetic movements of gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb; @Dicko2017-wz]. One hypothesis is that the cephalic furrow act as a barrier to the tissue flows and orients the germ band extension towards the posterior [@Dicko2017-wz]. However, the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not been investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac].-->


<!--General introduction to cephalic furrow topic-->

The cephalic furrow remains the least understood morphogenetic movements of
*Drosophila* gastrulation. Its transient nature makes the cephalic furrow
particularly challenging to investigate, and partly the reason why only a few
mutants have been identified. Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be
able to investigate the cephalic furrow formation.

<!--The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone-->

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is a convergent zone of
tissue flow during gastrulation. In early stages the relatively static head
tissues contrast with the ventral-moving trunk tissues. In wild type this
ventral flow is directed and enhanced by the active pull from the cephalic
furrow, while in mutants the flow more variable and restricted more
posteriorly. A similar flow has been predicted numerically where the formation
of the cephalic furrow would direct the tissue flows of the entire embryo
[@ref]. That is what we observe in vivo in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Late forces lead to epithelial instability-->

<!--Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains-->

In late stages we describe the presence of ectopic folds in the head--trunk
epithelia in the absence of the cephalic furrow. Our analyses suggest that
mechanical rather than genetic forces underlie the instability in the monolayer
epithelia which leads to tissue buckling. Mechanical folds occur in... [@refs]
and are influenced by this and that. The influence of mitotic forces in
adjacent cells is being investigated [@ref]. They have been shown to exert
forces during expansion [@ref], and associated with the formation of ectopic
folds by creating an imbalance of forces in contractile tissues [@ref]. We find
the expansion of mitotic domains indeed influences the stability of adjacent
tissues and bias the position of folding events. The in silico model reveals
the mitotic strain leads to buckling only when the tissue is next to a stiffer
tissue.

<!--Germ band elongation is required for ectopic folds-->

Unexpectedly, we determined this influence to be from the germ band extension
at the head--trunk boundary via tissue compression. This shows evidence of the
long range global impact the germ band extension exerts during gastrulation.
The interactions between gastrulation movements have been investigated in...
[@ref] for this and that. These works have shown how tissue interactions shape
morphogenesis but usually on a shorter range. Our data reveals long-range
interaction during gastrulation where the extension of the germ band compresses
tissues at the head--trunk interface.

<!--TODO: Discussion tissue fluidity here?-->

<!--Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position-->

Overall, our data suggests that in the absence of the cephalic furrow, the
tissue flows at the head--trunk boundary are disrupted, and the expansion
caused by mitotic domains combined with the compression caused by the germ band
extension increases tissue strain at the head--trunk boundary, which the
outcome is the formation of stochastic ectopic folds of mechanical origin. This
overview allowed us to speculate on the putative developmental role of the
cephalic furrow for gastrulation.

Thus, what the cephalic furrow accomplishes during gastrulation is to
anticipate the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary by priming the
position of a predictable (and genetically-determined fold). The convergent
tissue interactions are directed and buffered by the cephalic furrow
invagination. The cephalic furrow thus prevents the epithelial instability in
an area of potential tissue interactions, and with that potential defects
associated with erratic buckling, such as the compromise of cell-to-cell
interactions or short-range signaling in the epithelia, and thus ensure a
stereotypical balance of forces required for the precise patterning of
embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

<!--Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary, to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus preventing erratic epithelial buckling.-->

<!--## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes-->

<!--The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.-->

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process. That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process caused by the germ band was not.-->

<!--Overall, our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.-->

<!--## Conclusions-->

<!--Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila. The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.-->
