# Abstract

Mechanical forces are crucial for driving and shaping the morphogenesis of tissues and organs during embryonic development.
However, their relevance for the evolution of morphogenetic processes remains poorly understood.
Here we show that a morphogenetic innovation present in fly embryos---a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow---plays a mechanical role during *Drosophila* gastrulation.
By integrating *in vivo* experiments and *in silico* simulations, we find that the formation of the cephalic furrow effectively prevents mechanical instabilities at the head--trunk epithelium by absorbing the compressive stresses generated by concurrent morphogenetic movements.
Furthermore, by comparing the expression of known and novel genes involved in cephalic furrow formation between fly species, we find that the presence of the cephalic furrow is linked to the appearance of a novel *buttonhead* expression domain at the head--trunk boundary.
These data suggest that the genetic control of cephalic furrow formation was established through the integration of a new player into the ancestral head--trunk patterning system, and that mechanical instability may have been the selective pressure associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow.
Our findings uncover empirical evidence for how mechanical forces can influence the evolution of morphogenetic innovations in early development.

# Main

<!--## Evolution of morphogenesis-->

<!--Interplay of patterning and mechanics in the evolution of morphogenesis-->

Morphogenesis is a physical process [@Keller2012-ca; @Heisenberg2013-pl].
When embryonic tissues extend or invaginate, they push and pull on neighboring tissues.
These mechanical interactions provide essential information to embryonic cells throughout development and ultimately shape the final morphology of tissues and organs [@Collinet2021-qa].
However, how mechanical forces influence the evolution of morphogenesis in early embryonic development remains unclear.
To investigate the interplay between genetics and mechanics during the evolution of morphogenesis, we studied a prominent but enigmatic epithelial fold that forms at the head--trunk boundary of flies during gastrulation---the cephalic furrow [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Spencer2015-td].

<!--## Cephalic furrow as a model-->

<!--Patterned epithelial folding and the case of the cephalic furrow-->

Cephalic furrow formation in *Drosophila* is under strict genetic control.
It is one of the earliest morphogenetic events of gastrulation, beginning as paired lateral indentations which quickly invaginate to form a deep epithelial fold at the boundary between the head (procephalon) and the trunk (germ band) [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw; @Spencer2015-td].
The site of invagination is determined by the zygotic expression of two transcription factors, *buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*), whose domains overlap at the head--trunk boundary by a narrow row of blastoderm cells [@Vincent1997-fa].
The position of the cephalic furrow is thus specified with remarkable accuracy [@Liu2013-lc].
These so-called initiator cells shorten along the apical--basal axis by activating lateral myosin contractility which drives the infolding of the tissue [@Eritano2020-mi].
In addition, the mechanical coupling between cells ensures a precise and stereotypic morphogenetic process of tissue folding [@Eritano2020-mi].
The resulting fold spans the entire lateral surface, from dorsal to ventral, making the cephalic furrow a landmark of *Drosophila* gastrulation [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw].

Unlike other embryonic invaginations, however, the cephalic furrow has no obvious function.
While the ventral furrow gives rise to mesodermal precursors and the midgut invaginations give rise to endodermal tissues, the cephalic furrow does not give rise to any specific structure and, after a couple of hours, unfolds leaving no trace [@Hartenstein1985-zs].
Therefore, despite forming under tight genetic control, the role of the cephalic furrow during development has remained unclear.
While it has been thought to serve as a temporary tissue storage [@Turner1977-ol] or as a tissue anchor during gastrulation [@Costa1993-qj; @Dicko2017-wz], these hypotheses have not been investigated *in vivo* or considered in a phylogenetic context.
Remarkably, recent evidence from an independent study by Dey *et al.* ^(footnote^[^note]^)^ indicates that the cephalic furrow is an evolutionary novelty that originated within Diptera [@Dey2023-mo], making it an ideal model for investigating how patterned morphogenetic processes in early embryonic development evolve.

[^note]: This study has been submitted back-to-back with the present manuscript. Both pre-prints are available on bioRxiv.

<!--The invagination is only present in a derived group of cyclorraphan flies, but is absent in the remaining basally-branching dipteran flies [@Dey2023-mo].-->
<!--The clear origin in the phylogenetic tree makes the cephalic furrow an ideal model for investigating how patterned morphogenetic processes evolve.-->

Our work integrates genetics and mechanics to uncover the developmental role and evolutionary origins of the cephalic furrow.
First, we analyzed how perturbing cephalic furrow formation impacts gastrulation in *Drosophila* by live imaging mutant embryos, and find that the absence of the cephalic furrow increases the mechanical instability of the blastoderm epithelium.
Using a combination of *in vivo* experiments and *in silico* simulations, we show that the cephalic furrow effectively prevents this instability by absorbing compressive stresses, and thus, plays a mechanical role during gastrulation.
Next, to uncover the changes in genetic patterning associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow, we compared the expression of head--trunk patterning genes between *Drosophila* and *Clogmia*, a fly belonging to a basally-branching group of dipterans which do not form a cephalic furrow.
We find that while the ancestral head--trunk patterning system is conserved between the two flies, *Clogmia* lacks the head--trunk domain of *btd* that is present in *Drosophila*, suggesting that the appearance of a novel *btd* domain at the head--trunk boundary was a key event associated with cephalic furrow evolution.
Taken together, these data suggest that the evolution of the cephalic furrow patterning system occurred through the cooption of a novel genetic player, and that the underlying selective pressure may have been the mechanical instability during gastrulation.
Our findings reveal an interplay between genetic patterning and mechanical forces during the evolution of morphogenesis in early development.

<!--TODO: Improve this ending.-->

<!--The cephalic furrow retains a significant number of blastoderm cells beneath the surface of the embryo during gastrulation (about 10% according to recent estimates [@Stern2021-zv]),-->
<!--The mechanisms controlling the formation of the cephalic furrow remain poorly understood [@Gilmour2017-um]-->
<!--But the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other morphogenetic movements have not been investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac].-->
<!--Current models for the cephalic furrow account for the mechanics of the invagination [@Eritano2020-mi; @Jeffery2023; @OlderModel], but not the global context of how it interacts with neighbouring tissues during gastrulation.-->

# Results

## Mechanical role of cephalic furrow formation

To understand the physical consequences of perturbing the formation of the cephalic furrow in *Drosophila*, we generated fluorescent lines carrying a membrane marker and a loss of function allele for genes known to affect cephalic furrow formation---*btd*, *eve*, and *paired* (*prd*) [@Vincent1997-fa; @Blankenship2001-tm].
In *prd* mutants, the cephalic furrow is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm], while in *btd* and *eve* mutants the cephalic furrow is absent [@Vincent1997-fa].
To capture the tissue dynamics during gastrulation and the relative timing of developmental events, we imaged these mutant embryos using lightsheet microscopy *in toto* and with high temporal resolution.

### Initiator cell behavior is disrupted in cephalic furrow mutants

Our recordings show that the behavior of initiator cells is perturbed in the three mutants, but in different ways ({@fig:ectopic-folding}a).
In wildtype embryos, the initiator cells undergo cell shortening and anisotropic apical constriction at the end of cellularization [@Spencer2015-td] ({@fig:initiator}a,b).
In *prd* mutants, these behaviors are delayed but the initiators still shorten and constrict apically, forming a clear infolding point in the epithelium about six minutes after gastrulation ({@fig:initiator}a,b). 
However, *prd* initiators lack the typical arched profile of the wildtype initiators, and the resulting fold is abnormal, indicating that cephalic furrow formation is not only delayed but also perturbed.
In *btd* mutants, the initiator cells do not shorten, but show a reduced degree of apical constriction which creates a small indentation in epithelium of some embryos ({@fig:initiator}a,b, {!@fig:vid-initiator}), possibly due to the myosin activity at the head--trunk interface [@Eritano2020-mi].
In contrast, *eve* mutants show neither apical constriction nor cell shortening and the epithelium remains flat until about ten minutes after gastrulation ({@fig:initiator}a,b).
Therefore, while initiator behavior is abnormal in *prd* mutants, the cellular basis for cephalic furrow formation---the early shortening of initiator cells---is only severely disrupted in *btd* and *eve*.
Nevertheless, about 10--15 min after the onset of gastrulation in *btd* and *eve* mutants, we observe the formation of epithelial folds near the canonical position of the cephalic furrow ({@fig:ectopic-folding}b,c, {@fig:initiator}a).

<!--TODO: Create video for btd initiator cells {!@fig:vid-initiator-btd}-->
<!--TODO: Create video for prd initiator cells {!@fig:vid-initiator-prd}-->

### Ectopic folds form at the head--trunk boundary
<!--### Ectopic folds more frequent in cephalic furrow mutants-->

<!--TODO: Re-write paragraphs to incorporate wildtype and mutant EFs?-->
<!--TODO: Move observation of ectopic folding to the next paragraph?-->

The appearance of a late fold was first noted in *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa], and only more recently observed in *btd* mutants [@Eritano2020-mi], but their significance and the mechanisms driving their formation have remained unclear.
Our recordings show that in all embryos where the cephalic furrow fails to initiate properly, several ectopic folds appear near the canonical site of cephalic furrow invagination ({@fig:ectopic-folding}a,b,c, {!@fig:vid-lateral-btd}, {!@fig:vid-lateral-eve}).
They appear 15 min after the cephalic furrow would have formed, when the germ band is extended to around 35% of the egg length ({@fig:ectopic-folding}a,c,d, {@tbl:gbtime}), and then disappear in about 20 min---faster than the wildtype cephalic furrow.
Ectopic folds have a wider and often asymmetric cleft compared to the cephalic furrow, and lack the typical cell morphologies of the invagination, such as the wedge-shaped initiator cells and elongated edge cells [@Spencer2015-td] ({@fig:ectopic-folding}b, {!@fig:vid-profile-btd}, {!@fig:vid-profile-eve}).
Unlike the cephalic furrow, the position of ectopic folds varies between individual mutant embryos as they can form anterior, posterior, or near the wildtype site of invagination ({@fig:ectopic-folding}f, {@fig:features}b, {!@fig:vid-dynamics-btd}, {!@fig:vid-variability-btd}).
Finally, ectopic folds show more variable kinetics ({@fig:features}d,e), are 25% shallower ({@fig:features}f), and occupy an area 50% smaller compared to the cephalic furrow ({@fig:ectopic-folding}g,h, {@fig:features}c).
Such differences in morphology and dynamics suggest that the cephalic furrow and the ectopic folds form via distinct mechanisms.

<!--TODO: Merge with previous section?-->

To better understand the mechanisms of ectopic folding, we analyzed the phenomenon more broadly in our datasets and found that ectopic folds may also occur in embryos with a cephalic furrow (*i.e.*, *btd* or *eve* heterozygotes, *prd* hetero- or homozygotes, and wildtype).
These ectopic folds, however, differ from the ectopic folds of cephalic mutants in two key aspects.
While the frequency of ectopic folding is high in cephalic furrow mutants (>93%)---nearly every *btd* and *eve* homozygote shows one or more ectopic folds per embryo side (2.0±1.0 and 1.8±0.6, respectively) ({@fig:ectopic-folding}b, {@fig:features}a)---the frequency of ectopic folding in the other embryos is lower, ranging between 12% (*eve* heterozygotes) and 80% (wildtype embryos) ({@tbl:stats}).
In addition, the area of ectopic folds in wildtype embryos is 3--4x smaller than the area of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants ({@fig:features}g--k, {@tbl:area}).
Thus, cephalic furrow mutants have more frequent and more prominent ectopic folds compared to wildtype embryos.
These data provide evidence that the absence of the cephalic furrow is causally linked to an increase in the frequency and in the magnitude of ectopic folding during *Drosophila* gastrulation.

Altogether, the variable positions and frequency of ectopic folding suggests that they are not under genetic control comparable to that of the cephalic furrow, but that they may form as a result of physical interactions in the tissue.

<!--TODO:AB: Quantify the variability of ectopic folds in some way (plot it)-->

### Ectopic folding coincides with mitotic domain expansion and germ band extension

The formation of ectopic folds coincides spatiotemporally with two other concurrent processes of gastrulation: the expansion of mitotic domains and the extension of the germ band ({@fig:ectopic-folding}a,c,d,e).
Mitotic domains are groups of blastoderm cells that divide in synchrony during cleavage cycle 14 in *Drosophila*, first appearing in the head around 20 min after gastrulation [@Foe1989-cw].
In cephalic furrow mutants, ectopic folds appear in between mitotic domains, or between the posterior Mitotic Domain 6 (MD6) and the extending germ band ({@fig:mitotic-strain}a,c).
The dividing cells lose their basal attachment, round up at the apical side, and more than double (2.3x) their apical area during anaphase ({@fig:apical-strain}a), compressing any adjacent cells.
Compressed, non-dividing are the first to buckle ({@fig:mitotic-strain}b).
The buckling of ectopic folds is about 3x faster than the progressive invagination of the cephalic furrow (about 14 min) ({@fig:initiator}a, {!@fig:vid-mitotic-fold}).
Mitotic expansions always precede ectopic folding ({@fig:mitotic-strain}c,d, {@fig:initiator}a, {@tbl:gbtime}), suggesting that compressive stresses from the mitotic expansions and germ band extension may be contributing to their formation. 

<!--To uncover the physical interactions driving the ectopic fold formation, we investigated two concurrent gastrulation processes: cell divisions in mitotic domains and the extension of the germ band.-->

<!--TODO: Add pvalues somewhere.-->

To estimate the forces acting on the buckling tissue, we measured the rate of tissue deformation (strain rate) at the head--trunk and trunk--germ boundaries using particle image velocimetry ({@fig:mitotic-strain}e).
We find that the strain rate at the head--trunk boundary of *btd* mutants is 1.3x higher than in sibling controls, with a peak that coincides with the maximum expansion of mitotic domains and appearance of ectopic folds ({@fig:mitotic-strain}f, {@fig:apical-strain}b, {!@fig:vid-strain-rate}).
This indicates that ectopic folds form between mitotic domains at least in part due to the compressive stress generated by mitotic expansions.
At the trunk--germ boundary, we observe a steady increase in the strain rate ({@fig:mitotic-strain}f) that correlates with the compressed profile of cells between MD6 and germ band ({@fig:mitotic-strain}e).
To evaluate if the tissue at the trunk--germ boundary is under compression, we performed larger laser ablations orthogonal to the expected force vectors in wildtype embryos and tracked pairs of vertices from non-ablated cells on each side of the cut.
While in control embryos the distance between vertices remains more or less constant, in ablated embryos this distance decreases over time ({@fig:mitotic-strain}g).
This suggests that the tissue might be “collapsing on itself” due to adjacent compressive stresses, and is congruent with the hypothesis that the trunk--germ interface is under compression from the extending germ band.
Taken together, these analyses suggest the expansion of mitotic domains, and the extension of the germ band are potential sources of mechanical stress to the epithelial monolayer, and that they may be involved in the formation of ectopic folds by tissue buckling.

<!--TODO: Laser cut experiments. Consider adding them here starting with: “MD and GB generate mechanical forces and tissue flows that converge to the head--trunk boundary. If that’s the case, we expect that these tissues are under compression, and thus, would not show any recoil if cut using laser. To test that...”. The reasoning would almost the same as the one from the next paragraph: we observe that when MD and GB generate opposing flows at the same time the epithelial undergoes a buckling transition forming ectopic folds, we observe that the first epithelial cells to buckle are usually non-dividing between MDs and between MD/GB that become compressed immediately before the formation of the EF, these observations in combination with our models suggested that compressive stresses are driving a buckling transition in CF mutants, which in addition in a mutant situation there’s an excess of tissue in the surface due to the absence of the CF and the threshold for a buckling transition is even lower and these compressive forces are even more effective, if that’s the case, if these epithelial cells are being compressed and are under pressure we expect that a cut orthogonal to the predicted forces would show no recoil and possibly the tissue would collapse in itself. To test this hypothesis in vivo we performed painstaking laser cuts in cephalic furrow mutants and saw just that, if non-dividing cells between MDs or between MD/GB are cut we see no recoil, this supports our view that compressive forces are the essential driving forces underlying EF formation in cephalic furrow mutants and additionally it reveals that the HT is under compressive stresses from at least these two opposing morphogenetic events at gastrulation the MD and GB-->

### Physical model predicts increased mechanical instability

To determine the relative contribution of mitotic domains and germ band as sources of mechanical stress on the head--trunk boundary, we created a physical model to simulate these tissue mechanics *in silico* and performed experimental perturbations to test our theoretical predictions *in vivo* (see below).

Our model represents an epithelial monolayer confined inside a rigid shell.
It embodies one side of a frontal slice between the midline and the dorsal apex of a *Drosophila* embryo with its typical morphological proportions ({@fig:fold-model}a, {@fig:model-features}a).
The blastoderm is modeled by an elliptical arc of equidistant particles connected by springs and enclosed on one side by a rigid barrier representing the vitelline envelope ({@fig:fold-model}b).
The total energy per unit length of this tissue ($W_T$) is a sum of a stretching energy component ($W_s$) and a bending energy component ($W_b$) ({@fig:fold-model}c).
Each of these components have a rigidity associated with them.
$K_s$ is the stretching rigidity and $K_b$ is the bending rigidity.
These two parameters can be combined into a single dimensionless bending rigidity, $K_{b}^{\text{*}}$ ({@fig:fold-model}c).
To simulate the physical interactions between mitotic domains, germ band, and cephalic furrow, we defined the mitotic domains as compressed regions which tend to expand (they contain more particles compared to the surrounding regions), and the cephalic furrow as a narrow region having an intrinsic negative curvature predisposing the tissue to invaginate ({@fig:fold-model}b).
The germ band in our model is defined by the position of the posterior end of the tissue ($g$) which is fixed at different fractions of egg length for each simulation ({@fig:fold-model}b).
The effect of germ band extension appears as a global compression in the blastoderm.
Finally, to run the simulations we added a ground level of random noise, and iterated the model towards an equilibrium in the total energy of the system (see Methods).

We first characterized the general properties of the model.
In simulations where folds begin to form, the bending energy increases while releasing a larger amount of stretching energy which in turn decreases the total energy of the system over the iterations ({@fig:fold-model}d).
The increase in bending energy coincides with a rapid deepening of the fold.
Once the bending energy reaches a peak, the fold continues to deepen, though more gradually, but the number of folds stabilizes and there are rarely changes in the overall folding patterns ({@fig:fold-model}d, {@fig:model-features}b).
Folding events are stochastic and can happen at different iterations across different simulations.
Also, we are mainly interested in analyzing the initial position and the number of folding events in each simulation.
Hence, we used the state of each simulation at the peak of its bending energy as the reference point to compare with other simulations.

<!--TODO:AB: Describe overfolding events. Mark them on phase diagram. Discuss as limitation-->

To obtain realistic values of the dimensionless bending rigidity $K_{b}^{\text{*}}$ where the model matches experimental observations, we performed a sweep across the parameter space in conditions mimicking the mutants without the cephalic furrow.
As expected, the probability of buckling increases with the amount of germ band extension, mainly in lower bending rigidities ({@fig:fold-model}e, {@fig:model-features}c).
At 10% germ band extension, we observe a buckling transition in the phase space of softer conditions ($K_{b}^{\text{*}} \approx 0.7 \times 10^{−4}$), but in stiffer conditions ($K_{b}^{\text{*}} \approx 1.2 \times 10^{−4}$) the germ band alone, even at its maximum extension, cannot drive the formation of ectopic folds ({@fig:fold-model}e, {@fig:model-features}c).
Adding mitotic domains to the simulations changed the phase diagram and dynamics of ectopic folding.
We observe that mitotic domains alone can induce ectopic folds in softer conditions ($K_{b}^{\text{*}} < 1.1 \times 10^{−4}$) and that the number of folds increased for low values of germ band extension ({@fig:fold-model}f).
In addition, the number of iterations until a first folding event occurs is lower in conditions with mitotic domains, especially in simulations with 0--20% of germ band extension ({@fig:model-features}d).
These simulations suggest that, depending on the bending rigidity, the germ band or mitotic domains alone can drive ectopic folding, and that their combined action may increase the mechanical instabilities in the blastoderm epithelium.
We thus set to test the individual contribution of mitotic domains and germ band to the epithelial instability by performing perturbation experiments *in vivo*.

<!--TODO:AB: Give a physics-based estimation of order of magnitude of dimensionless parameter from literature. Good sanity check to see if values are not off the charts!-->

### Mitotic domains and germ band extension drive tissue buckling

<!--Mitotic domains are required for ectopic folding in vivo-->

We first asked whether the extension of the germ band alone can generate ectopic folds.
To that end, we generated double-mutant flies lacking both the cephalic furrow and the mitotic domains by combining *btd* mutants with a loss-of-function allele of *cdc25* or *string* (*stg*), a phosphatase that regulates the cell divisions in cleavage cycle 14 of *Drosophila* [@Edgar1989-hv].
In *stg* mutants, the formation of the cephalic furrow and of other morphogenetic movements during early gastrulation occur normally [@Edgar1989-hv] ({@fig:live-details}a,b, {!@fig:vid-stg-lateral}, {!@fig:vid-stg-dorsal}).
Compared to wildtype, the ectopic folds in *stg* mutants are less frequent and primarily appear near the trunk--germ interface ({@tbl:stats}), which suggests that mitotic domains affects ectopic folding.
Indeed, in *btd*--*stg* double-mutant embryos, we find no ectopic folds forming at the head--trunk interface ({@fig:live-experiments}a,b,j (left), {!@fig:vid-double-lateral}, {!@fig:vid-double-dorsal}).
The experiment shows that mitotic domains are required for ectopic folding, and the push from the germ band extension alone is insufficient to induce ectopic buckling in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Germ band extension is required for ectopic folding in vivo-->

To test whether mitotic domains alone are sufficient to induce ectopic buckling *in vivo*, we mechanically blocked the extension of the germ band in cephalic furrow mutants.
For that, we cauterized a patch of dorsal tissue, attaching it to the vitelline envelope at the onset of gastrulation ({@fig:live-experiments}c).
When the germ band extension is blocked in *btd* and *eve* mutants, no ectopic folds appear at the head--trunk interface ({@fig:live-experiments}c,d,j (middle), {!@fig:vid-cautlat-eve}, {!@fig:vid-cautdor-eve}, {!@fig:vid-cautdor-btd}).
Mitotic expansions compress the neighboring non-dividing cells, but no buckling occurs ({@fig:live-experiments}c).
Cauterized mutant embryos also show less epithelial deformations compared to non-cauterized mutant embryos ({@fig:live-experiments}d,g).
These experiments reveal that *in vivo*, the local expansions of mitotic domains are insufficient to cause epithelial buckling at the head--trunk interface, and that the germ band extension is required.

Altogether, the experiments show that, in cephalic furrow mutants, neither mitotic domain nor germ band can promote ectopic folding by themselves.
With this crucial insight, we could then look back to our model and identify the bending rigidity value where these biological behaviors are recapitulated in the simulations.
For that, we determined at which bending rigidity the average number of folds falls below 1 in mitotic-domains-only and germ-band-only conditions ({@fig:model-features}c,d).
The criteria is fulfilled when the bending rigidity is $K_{b}^{\text{*}} \approx 1.0 \times 10^{−4}$.
This specific value establishes an important bridge between our *in vivo* and *in silico* data by revealing where the embryo resides within the parameter space of the model, and by providing a biologically relevant reference for subsequent simulations.

To compare our reference bending rigidity with direct measurements, we calculated $K_{b}^{\text{*}}$ for the bending rigidity estimates in MDCK monolayers ($K_{b} \approx 5 \times 10^{-13} Nm$ and $K_{s} \approx 0.2 Nm^{-1}$) [@Trushko2020-gf; @Fouchard2020-km] (Supplementary Note 1).
Given that in elastic sheets the bending and stretching rigidity ratio is proportional to the square of the height ($K_{b}/K_{s} \propto h^2$) [@Efrati2009-ve], we adjusted the calculation to the estimated thickness of the MDCK monolayer (~18µm) [@Fouchard2020-km].
The value we obtained in this way for the effective $K_{b}^{\text{*}}$ of a height-adjusted MDCK monolayer, $\approx 1.8 \times 10^{-4}$, is within a factor of 2 of our own reference bending rigidity, indicating that the relevant region of parameter space we identified in our model is consistent with existing direct measurements of bending rigidity in other tissues.

<!--and is therefore likely to be physiologically relevant-->

Simulations at our reference bending rigidity regime reveal a correlation between increased compressive stresses and buckling instability.
When both mitotic domains and germ band are present *in silico*, there is an increase in tissue compression that maximizes the number and speed of ectopic fold formation ({@fig:model-features}c,d).
Similarly, we propose the mechanical instability in cephalic furrow mutants may be due to an increase in the compressive stresses at the head–trunk boundary, generated by the combined formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension during early gastrulation.

### Cephalic furrow formation prevents mechanical instability

The increased mechanical instability in cephalic furrow mutants led us to hypothesize that the temporary storage of invaginated cells may contribute to absorbing the compressive stresses generated by mitotic domains and germ band in wildtype conditions.
To explore the role of the cephalic furrow as a mechanical buffer, we analyzed *in vivo* and computationally how it interacts with mitotic domains and with the germ band, and how it influences the formation of ectopic folds.

<!--Cephalic furrow invaginates autonomously pulling adjacent tissues-->

First, we determined how the cephalic furrow influences the mechanics of the surrounding tissue and how far such influence spreads away from the furrow. 
By laser ablating cell membranes at different distances from initiator cells in early wildtype embryos, we find that the recoil velocity increases with time and decreases with distance, with an approximate range of at least 40µm anterior and posterior to the initiator cells ({@fig:live-experiments}i).
This suggests that the cell shortening of initiator cells, which is actively driven by lateral myosin contractility [@Eritano2020-mi], pulls on the adjacent cells and generates tension in the surrounding tissues.

<!--Cephalic furrow forms normally but is shallower in cauterized wildtype-->

Since our experiments indicate that the germ band is compressing the head--trunk tissues, we asked whether the extension of the germ band can influence the depth of the cephalic furrow.
To test *in vivo* whether the presence of the germ band impacts the formation of the cephalic furrow, we blocked the germ band extension by cauterization in wildtype embryos.
The cephalic furrow forms normally in cauterized embryos indicating that the germ band extension is not required for its formation ({@fig:live-experiments}e,f,j (right)).
We measured the maximum depth of the cephalic furrow between cauterized and non-cauterized embryos, and found it is only 15% shallower after cauterization ({@fig:live-experiments}h).
These experiments corroborate the view that cephalic furrow initiation is autonomous and independent of other morphogenetic movements of gastrulation, such as the germ band extension which only has a mild influence on the final depth of the invagination.

<!--This result needs to be corroborated with a larger sample size, but it provides initial evidence that the germ band extension has a mild influence on the final depth of the cephalic furrow.-->

<!--These experiments rule out the germ band extension as a driver of cephalic furrow invagination, and give support to the notion that the cephalic furrow forms autonomously by independent active mechanisms which are .-->

<!--The simulations show that the average depth of the cephalic furrow correlates with the percentage of germ band extension ({@fig:fold-model}i).-->
<!--Mitotic activity and germ band elongation contributes to the depth of the cephalic furrow [@Campos-Ortega1997-rd].-->

<!--TODO:AB: Is the increase in recoil velocity because CF or epithelial maturation?-->

Next, we tested the conditions that impact the effectiveness of the cephalic furrow in preventing the formation of ectopic folds in the model.

<!--Timing rather than force more effective at preventing ectopic folding-->

In our model, we programmed the cephalic furrow by establishing an intrinsic negative curvature ($\kappa_o^{CF}$) to a narrow region of the particle--spring blastoderm that matches the span of the initiator cells *in vivo* ({@fig:fold-model}a, {@fig:model-features}a).
Using the bending rigidity fine-tuned with the previous simulations and experiments, we ran a parameter sweep for different values of $\kappa_o^{CF}$ and established a baseline ($\kappa_o^{CF}>0.3$) where the invagination forms in a robust manner with minimal variability, phenocopying the cephalic furrow *in vivo* ({@fig:model-features}a).

We ran simulations changing the strength of the cephalic furrow, the timing of mitotic domain formation, and the percentage of germ band extension, and quantified the frequency, the position, and the depth of ectopic folds.
Without the germ band, the presence of an active invagination at the head--trunk region reduced the variability of ectopic folding in the neighborhood of the cephalic furrow ({@fig:fold-model}g).
This influence of the cephalic furrow on ectopic folds correlates with the strength of the pull, with higher values preventing ectopic folds more effectively ({@fig:fold-model}g, {@fig:model-features}e, {@fig:model-features}b).
Curiously, this buffering effect diminished with the extension of the germ band for intermediate values of $\kappa_o^{CF}$ ({@fig:model-features}b).
The cephalic furrow becomes shallower and there is an increase in ectopic folds at the posterior region.
Only larger $\kappa_o^{CF}$ values remained effective in preventing ectopic folds at high percentages of germ band extension ({@fig:model-features}b).
This suggests that in these conditions, the forces generated by the mitotic expansions and by the germ band extension dominate over the infolding pull of the cephalic furrow.

Given that in wildtype embryos the cephalic furrow forms around 15 min before mitotic domains, we asked whether their relative timing of formation may influence the effectiveness of the cephalic furrow.
Indeed, when we added a delay to the formation of mitotic domains, the cephalic furrow is more effective in preventing ectopic folding even for lower $\kappa_o^{CF}$ values and for greater percentages of germ band extension ({@fig:fold-model}g, {@fig:model-features}e, {@fig:model-features}b).
Ectopic folds only form in the posterior region near the germ band tip, a position notably similar to where the dorsal folds form in the *Drosophila* embryo *in vivo*.

Finally, we tested how the position of the cephalic furrow impacts its ability to prevent ectopic folding.
Similar to the simulations of the cephalic furrow at ~65% embryo length {@fig:fold-model}g (the wildtype position), formation of the cephalic furrow at >70% embryo length, when the germ band is not extended (*g*=0), also effectively prevents ectopic folding in the head ({@fig:fold-model}h).
However, when the cephalic furrow is moved further back <50% embryo length, ectopic folding around mitotic domains becomes more frequent.
Conversely, when the germ band is extended (*g*=0.4), a cephalic furrow located more posteriorly along the anteroposterior axis (<30% embryo length) will prevent ectopic folding, while a cephalic furrow located more anteriorly (>50% embryo length) will fail to do so and ectopic folding appears at the posterior region ({@fig:fold-model}h).
These simulations reveal that when the cephalic furrow is positioned between 40-60% embryo length, it is the most effective at preventing ectopic folding throughout the different phases of germ band extension.

<!--TODO: Add full parameter sweeps as supplementary notes-->

Taken together, our physical model provides a theoretical basis that a fold like the cephalic furrow, when forming before other morphogenetic events and around the central portion of the anteroposterior axis, can effectively absorb compressive stresses and prevent mechanical instabilities in embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

<!--TODO: Timing effectiveness is not exemplified in the last panel-->

<!--TODO: Add evolutionary question here or after genes?-->

## Genetic innovation at the head--trunk boundary

<!--
- Function depends on timing and position that depends on patterning
- Is the patterning conserved in species with or without cephalic furrow?
- We identified slp as a cephalic furrow gene (supp, screen, mutants, etc)
- Comparative expression across species (include prd?)
-->

As described above, the effectiveness of the cephalic furrow in preventing epithelial instabilities depends on the position and time of invagination.
This spatiotemporal control of the invagination in *Drosophila* is determined genetically by *btd*, *eve*, and *prd* expressed at the head--trunk boundary [@Vincent1997-fa; @Blankenship2001-tm].
However, it remains unclear if this genetic patterning is conserved across the dipteran phylogeny.
To uncover the gene expression changes associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow, we compared the expression of known and newly-identified genes between *Drosophila* and other fly species with and without the cephalic furrow.

### Ancestral *slp*--*eve* interaction defines head--trunk position

To uncover additional genes patterning the cephalic furrow, we performed a live-imaging screen with loss-of-function alleles of several candidates expressed at the head--trunk interface (Supplementary Note 2).
We find that null mutants for the *sloppy paired* (*slp*) transcription factors, *slp1* and *slp2*, show a delayed cephalic furrow that is shifted towards the anterior end by ~6% of the egg length (control = 67.6±1.4%, n=26; *slp* = 73.2±0.7%, n=7) ({@fig:genetic-patterning}a,b).
Since *slp1* is a known anterior repressor that positions anterior pair rule stripes [@Andrioli2004-qi; @Andrioli2012-fv], we wondered if the shift in the position of the cephalic furrow in *slp* mutants coincided with a shift in typical overlap between *btd* and *eve* stripe 1 at the head--trunk boundary.
Indeed, except for the wider gap between *eve* stripe 1 and 2, the typical overlap remains unaltered ({@fig:genetic-patterning}c--d, {@fig:genetic-features}a).
Cells expressing *btd* and *eve* are shifted anteriorly a few rows (control = 4.7±0.5 rows, n=4; *slp* = 7.3±0.7 rows, n=5) ({@fig:genetic-patterning}e).
However, they still give rise to initiator cells, indicating that the cephalic furrow patterning in *slp* mutants has been displaced but not disrupted.

By analyzing the expression from zygotic activation to gastrulation, we suggest that this anterior shift occurs because without slp, eve is not repressed at the anterior end.

To understand this phenotype, we analyzed the expression of *slp1* relative to *btd*, *eve*, and *prd* from the onset of zygotic activation to gastrulation.
Wildtype embryos at cycle 11 already express *slp1* at the anterior end and *eve* almost ubiquitously ({@fig:genetic-features}b).
At cycle 12, *eve* is cleared from the anterior end, and the two genes form juxtaposing territories that broadly correspond to the head and trunk regions of the embryo.
The boundary between *slp1* and *eve* expression domains is set at 65% embryo length and does not change until gastrulation and coincides with the head--trunk boundary and initiator cells of the cephalic furrow.
The anterior shift that occurs in slp mutants suggests that this early genetic interaction between slp and eve is altered, possibly with eve transcripts not being fully cleared from the anterior end, setting the boundary more anteriorly.

*btd* expression initiates secondarily at the interface between *slp* and *eve* ({@fig:genetic-patterning}f).

, that demarcate the boundary between the head and trunk regions ({@fig:genetic-patterning}f).

These data indicate that the early *slp* activity is an upstream factor required for positioning *eve* stripe 1 and *btd* domain, and consequently, important for determining the head--trunk boundary and the site of invagination for the cephalic furrow along the anteroposterior axis.

but it is unclear if this is conserved in other flies.
To uncover the changes in genetic patterning associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow, we compared the expression of known and newly-identified cephalic furrow genes between dipteran species with or without the invagination.

At the onset of gastrulation, the broad *slp* and *eve* domains progressively resolve into narrow abutting stripes which correspond to a central row of *eve*-expressing initiator cells surrounded by rows of *slp*-expressing adjacent cells ({@fig:genetic-patterning}g,i).

In addition, *prd* expression is offset to *slp* expression by a single row of cells and *btd* expression localizes to the anterior half of the cephalic furrow ({@fig:genetic-patterning}e).
Furthermore, the outer edges of the cephalic furrow are demarcated by *slp* expression ({@fig:genetic-patterning}i).
This combinatorial expression of transcription factors *btd*, *eve*, *slp*, and *prd*, indicates that each row of cells forming the invagination of the cephalic furrow has a unique transcriptional identity.
Since *slp* is crucial to maintain parasegment polarity by activating *wingless* and repressing *engrailed* [@Cadigan1994-hz], the expression of *slp* may also be important for establishing the individual cell identities around the cephalic furrow.

<!--it must occur at the head--trunk boundary and the initiation of the process must begin before other morphogenetic movements take place.-->

<!--Head--trunk boundary slp/eve expression is conserved-->
<!--Clogmia lacks the head--trunk domain of btd-->

the dipteran fly *Clogmia albipunctata*, a species from the basally-branching Psychodidae family which has no cephalic furrow [@Jimenez-Guri2014-zs; @Dey2023-pj].



To uncover the genetic patterning differences associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow, we compared the expression data of the above described cephalic furrow genes in *Drosophila* to *Clogmia*, which lacks a cephalic furrow.
We find that the early expression of *slp* and *eve* are highly similar between *Drosophila* and *Clogmia* as both genes are expressed in broad juxtaposing domains demarcating the head--trunk boundary ({@fig:genetic-patterning}f).
However, the expression of *btd* differs between the two species.
In *Drosophila* *btd* is expressed at the head--trunk boundary from early stages and a more anterior domain localized in the acron is activated at the onset of gastrulation ({@fig:genetic-patterning}f).
In *Clogmia*, the *btd* acron domain is expressed much earlier and, strikingly, the head--trunk domain is not present; *btd* is only expressed at a ventral patch in the foregut area ({@fig:genetic-patterning}f,h).
Additionally, the combinatorial expression of *slp*, *eve*, and *prd* at the onset of gastrulation is conserved between *Clogmia* and *Drosophila* ({@fig:genetic-patterning}j).
These data shows that both flies share a conserved head--trunk patterning system, and that the only significant difference is the presence of a head--trunk domain of *btd* in *Drosophila*.
Since *btd* is a crucial gene for cephalic furrow formation, this suggests that the origin of a novel expression domain of *btd* at the head--trunk boundary was a key event associated with the evolution of the cephalic furrow.

<!--- As an aside, curiously, the eye domain of btd is expressed very early in Clogmia while the same domain is delayed tremendously in Drosophila. Clogmia has larval eyes while Drosophila doesn’t. It could be that some portions of head development in Drosophila were just turned off.-->

<!--- It is probable that the expansion of btd along the head--trunk was or still is or originated with some other role in the patterning of the head, and that only later on it got coopted into the cephalic furrow program.-->
<!--- Could it be that this is a re-use of the anterior midgut program? There btd and eve overlap and there is an invagination. I wonder if it is also driven by lateral myosin.-->

<!--Clogmia is the sister group to Megaselia+Episyrphus+Drosophila [@Jimenez-Guri2013]-->
<!--Compare the dorsoventral patterning between Clogmia and Drosophila [@Wotton2017]. Apparently, Clogmia is ventralized while Drosophila dorsalized. The origin of this head--trunk btd domain could be that it expanded dorsally with the dorsalization.-->

# Discussion

<!--Head--trunk boundary under compressive stress-->

Our work investigates the function and evolution of the cephalic furrow---a patterned epithelial invagination that forms at the head--trunk boundary of dipteran flies.
We find that perturbing cephalic furrow formation in *Drosophila* makes the head--trunk epithelium unstable due to the compressive stresses generated by the concomitant formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension.
Dividing cells can impact the stability of epithelial monolayers because they generate in-plane outward forces during the elongation phase [@Gupta2021-oo] and undergo basal detachment, creating an imbalance in the tissue [@Ko2020-wk].
Mitotic rounding indeed induces epithelial folds in the tracheal placode of flies [@Kondo2013-gy] and in intestinal villi of mice [@Freddo2016-et], but it only occurs in the presence of an additional intraepithelial compressive force.
Our findings that only the combined action of mitotic domains and germ band can induce ectopic folds ({@fig:live-experiments}j) indicates that a similar mechanism could be at play in cephalic furrow mutants.
The role of mitotic domains and germ band as stressors is corroborated by complementary experiments performed in the independent study by Dey *et al.* [@Dey2023-mo], consolidating the evidence that the head--trunk interface of flies is under increased mechanical stress during gastrulation.
Since our experiments ({@fig:features}g,i--k) and simulations ({@fig:fold-model}g,h) show that the early formation of the cephalic furrow effectively inhibits the occurrence of ectopic folds, it gives support to the idea that the cephalic furrow is preventing the build up of these compressive stresses at the head--trunk boundary.
We propose, therefore, that the cephalic furrow safeguards the mechanical stability of the head--trunk boundary, and thus, accomplishes a physical role during *Drosophila* gastrulation.

<!--has a stress-absorbing role.-->

<!--Compressive forces are a key mechanism forming epithelial folds in development [@Nelson2016-gz; @Collinet2021-qa].-->
<!--Generating mechanical instability in particular when epithelial monolayers are under confinement [@Trushko2020-gf].-->
<!--The fact that *eve* mutants have no cell intercalation [@Collinet2015-af] suggests that the formation of ectopic folds depends on the rapid phase of germ band extension [@Campos-Ortega1985-ma], driven mainly by the posterior midgut invagination.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow absorbs stresses and prevents mechanical instability-->

<!--Cephalic furrow evolution link to tissue mechanics-->

This raises an intriguing evolutionary question---has the cephalic furrow evolved in response to mechanical instability?
For this to be the case, we expect that increased mechanical instability would be detrimental to the fitness of individuals.
While mechanical compression and tissue buckling have the potential to disrupt cell-to-cell interactions and short-range signaling at the head--trunk boundary, investigating these effects *in vivo* is challenging.
However, Dey *et al.* show that inhibiting cephalic furrow formation in *Drosophila* increases the frequency of a distorted ventral midline where the body axis becomes partially rotated during gastrulation [@Dey2023-mo].
This suggests that increased compressive stresses and variable ectopic buckling cause a mechanical imbalance between embryonic tissues which can impact the robustness of morphogenetic processes and potentially slow down embryogenesis.
In this sense, a patterned head invagination may have improved the robustness of gastrulation or allowed for faster development, providing an evolutionary advantage which was then positively selected.

<!--Such adverse effects may have been significant in certain situations, selection for developmental speed, for example which likely occurred during fly evolution.-->

<!--Out-of-plane divisions as alternative mechanical solution-->

Furthermore, the mapping of cephalic furrow traits on a dipteran phylogeny supports the hypothesis of mechanical instability as a selective pressure ({@fig:summary}a).
Mitotic domains and germ band extension (long germ) are ancestral traits common to Diptera while the cephalic furrow is a derived trait---an evolutionary novelty of cyclorraphan flies [@Dey2023-mo] ({@fig:summary}a).
The sources of stress, mitotic domains and germ band, were probably present at the dawn of dipterans.
This suggests that the head--trunk interface of flies may have endured mechanical instabilities long before the evolution of the cephalic furrow.
Remarkably, flies with no cephalic furrow, *Clogmia* and *Chironomus*, exhibit out-of-plane cell divisions exactly at the head--trunk boundary, suggesting that they evolved an alternative solution to mitigate the effect of tissue compression load during gastrulation [@Dey2023-mo] ({@fig:summary}a).
One key difference that might explain these divergent solutions for the same selective pressure is the expression of *btd* at the head--trunk boundary.
Neither *Clogmia* ({@fig:genetic-patterning}) nor *Chironomus* [@Dey2023-mo] exhibit the *btd*--*eve* expression overlap at the head--trunk boundary ({@fig:summary}a), a trait essential to specify the initiator cells in species with cephalic furrow like *Drosophila*.
Therefore, the establishment of a *btd*--*eve* overlap was probably a key event associated with the origin of the cephalic furrow.
In this evolutionary scenario, the mechanical instability was the underlying selective pressure leading to the cooption of novel expression domains and the genetic stabilization of a patterned cephalic furrow invagination ({@fig:summary}b).

<!--Facilitated by this novel transcriptional background-->
<!--the signaling pathway regulating lateral myosin activation-->
<!--coopted to control the behavior of initiator cells-->
<!--and genetically stabilized by natural selection.-->

<!--Scenario for cephalic furrow evolution-->

<!--Altogether, the genetic patterning and tissue mechanics data obtained in our study and in the study by Dey et al. raises the following evolutionary scenario for the cephalic furrow ({@fig:summary}b).-->
<!--The evolution of the long germ in Diptera had as a consequence the increase in global compressive stresses happening during fly gastrulation.-->
<!--These stresses led to more frequent and potentially detrimental mechanical instability in embryonic tissues.-->
<!--The establishment of out-of-plane divisions was one solution to mitigate and it probably occurred by the fixation of genetic mechanisms determining the orientation.-->
<!--Cyclorraphan took another route.-->
<!--The genetic stabilization occurred through the btd--eve overlap via cooption of yet unknown genetic signaling controlling lateral myosin activation.-->
<!--The invention of the cephalic furrow may have allowed for shorter developmental times or may be the responsible factor leading to increased mechanical instability.-->
<!--One idea is that shorter developmental times concatenated the formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension, increasing the mechanical instabilities at the head--trunk boundary, or alternatively, that flies that evolved the cephalic furrow allowed for shorter developmental times.-->

<!--TODO: Model to test if invagination is more effective than out-of-plane divisions.-->

<!--Broader implications for the interplay between mechanics and patterned morphogenesis-->
<!--Genetic stabilization of self-organized morphogenesis by natural selection-->
<!--Empirical support for this mechanism of generating morphogenetic innovations-->

Our cephalic furrow data reveals how the interplay between genetic patterning and tissue mechanics may have shaped the evolution of morphogenesis in the early development of flies.
However, we believe that these findings potentially uncover only one realization of a more general mechanism integrating tissue mechanics with developmental evolution.
Classical theoretical work by Newman and Müller raised the hypothesis that self-organized morphogenesis were critical to generate morphogenetic innovations at the dawn of animal evolution [@Newman2000-oz].
Or, in other words, that before genome-guided embryonic development, tissues would fold due to mechanical interactions between them and their environment, and that the developmental “programs” we know today were fixed secondarily by natural selection.
Our work provides initial empirical evidence in support of this hypothesis, showing that mechanical forces might have had a critical role in generating morphogenetic innovations not only at the transition to multicellularity, but also after the establishment of developmental patterning systems across evolutionary time.
We propose that the genetic resolution of mechanical conflicts between distinct embryonic processes may be a broadly occurring mechanism that contributes to generating the remarkable morphogenetic diversity of early animal embryogenesis.

<!--While the interplay between tissue mechanics and developmental evolution is poorly understood, classical theoretical work by Newman and Müller have raised the hypothesis that self-organized morphogenesis were critical to generate morphogenetic innovations at the dawn of animal evolution [@Newman2000-oz].-->
<!--Or, in other words, that before genome guided embryonic development evolved, tissues would fold due to mechanical interactions between them and the environment, and the patterned morphogenetic programs we know today were fixed secondarily by natural selection [@Newman2000-oz].-->

<!--Our work support this hypothesis by bringing empirical evidence from developmental and comparative data that mechanical forces might have a critical role in generating morphogenetic innovations in early development.-->

<!--In the case of the cephalic furrow, compressive stresses originating from concurrent gastrulation processes and resulting in ectopic epithelial buckling may have had a detrimental effect to the fitness of individuals.-->
<!--This mechanical instability could have acted as a selective pressure underlying the cooption of novel head--trunk gene expression domains and the establishment of a patterned cephalic furrow invagination.-->

<!--These speculations, however, require further testing with experiments that prevent cephalic furrow formation without other genetic side effects, as well as a systematic comparative analysis of mitotic domains, germ band extension, and tissue mechanics across the fly phylogeny.-->
<!--Overall, our work proposes that the cephalic furrow plays a mechanical role in absorbing compressive stresses in fly gastrulation, and introduces the cephalic furrow formation as powerful context to test the hypothesis that mechanical interactions within embryonic tissues may play an important role for the evolution of morphogenesis in early development.-->

<!--Alternatively, the evolution of the cephalic furrow was in fact the facilitator to allowing for faster development.-->

<!--Physical interaction of embryonic tissues with the egg shell are important for morphogenesis [@Bailles2019-qs; @Munster2019-ww]-->

<!--Our simulations also revealed the buckling events are influenced by the roundness of the vitelline envelope. Buckling occurs more easily on straighter shells. This might explain why buckling at the tips is less frequent. Friction plays a role in the shape of the fold [Trushko]. Recent works show how interactions of the embryonic tissues with the shell [@Munster;@Bailles] and between gastrulation movements [@Guo2021] are important to embryonic development. Insect eggs have an outstanding diversity [@Church]. This observation might have implications to how egg shape might have influenced the evolution of development. And reveal a glimpse of the complex mechanical underpinnings of gastrulation dynamics around the head--trunk boundary of bilaterians.-->

<!--Mechanical instability perturbs patterning and causes the loss of ATP, which may lead to  developmental delays-->

<!--Our findings also explain why so few cephalic furrow mutants have been identified. Because even though the cephalic furrow is disrupted, the tissue compression from other gastrulation movements will still make the epithelium fold, making the cephalic furrow phenotypes less obvious-->

<!--Dividing cells can’t do morphogenesis. That’s why mitotic domains occur in patches. Otherwise, gastrulation movements would fail.-->

# Methods

## *Drosophila* stocks and genetic crossings

To generate fluorescent cephalic furrow mutants, we performed genetic crosses using the loss-of-function alleles *btd^XA^* (FBal0030657), *eve^3^* (FBal0003885), *prd^4^* (FBal0013967), *slp^Δ34B^* (FBal0035631), and *stg^2^* (FBal0247234); the membrane fluorescent marker *Gap43-mCherry* (FBal0258719, gift from Kassiani Skouloudaki); and the green fluorescent balancers *FM7c, Kr-GFP* (FBst0005193), *CyO, twi-GFP* (gift from Akanksha Jain), and *TM3, Kr-GFP* (FBst0005195).
We established stable lines balancing the loss-of-function alleles with fluorescent balancers, and used the lack of GFP signal to identify homozygous embryos in our live-imaging recordings.
For genes on chromosomes 1 and 2 (*btd*, *eve*, and *prd*), we added the membrane marker on chromosome 3 ([*btd^XA^/FM7c, Kr-GFP;; Gap43-mCherry/MKRS*], [*eve^3^/CyO, twi-GFP; Gap43-mCherry/MKRS*], and [*slp^Δ34B^/CyO, twi-GFP; Gap43-mCherry/TM6B*]).
For *stg*, which is located on chromosome 3, we recombined the allele with Gap (*Gap43-mCherry, stg^2^/TM3, Kr-GFP*).
Since the *btd*--*stg* double mutant stable line is weak, we imaged the progeny of *btd^XA^/FM7c, Kr-GFP;; Gap43-mCherry, stg^2^/Gap43-mCherry* flies, identifying *btd* homozygozity by the GFP, and *stg* homozygozity by the lack of cell divisions after gastrulation.
For laser ablations, we used a *moe-GFP* line (gift from Elizabeth Knust).
The wildtype stocks contain the Gap43-mCherry marker in the Oregon-R genetic background.
We obtained the founder fly stocks from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center and the Kyoto Stock Center and deposited the lines in the MPI-CBG stock collection.
The complete list of FlyBase [@Gramates2022-xe] accession numbers and genotypes is available in the project’s data repository [@Vellutini2023-ng].

## Animal husbandry and embryo collection

We maintained the *Drosophila* stocks in 50mL hard plastic vials containing standard fly food and enclosed with a foam lid to allow air exchange.
They were kept in an incubator with a constant 25°C temperature and 65% humidity and a 12:12h light cycle.
For imaging, we first amplified the stocks in larger 200mL vials for a few weeks.
We then narcotized the flies with CO~2~, and transferred them to a cage with a plate attached to one end containing a layer of apple juice agar and a slab of yeast paste on top.
The flies were left to acclimatize in the cage for two days before the experiments.
To guarantee the embryos are at a similar developmental stage, we exchanged the agar plate once per hour at least twice (pre-lays), and let the flies lay the eggs on the agar for one hour before collecting the plate.
After filling the plate with water, we used a brush to release the eggs from the agar and transferred them to a cell strainer with 100µm nylon mesh (VWR).
To remove the chorion, we immersed the embryos in 20% bleach (sodium hypochlorite solution, Merck 1.05614.2500) for 90s, washed abundantly with water, and proceeded to mounting for live imaging.

We maintained *Clogmia* flies in plastic petri dishes with a layer of wet cotton at 25°C and fed weekly with powder parsley.
To obtain embryos for fixation, we collected the adult flies in a 200mL hard plastic vial with wet cotton, and let them mate for 2--3 days.
Then, we anesthetized the flies with CO~2~, dissected the ovaries from ripe females, and released the eggs using tweezers in deionized water, which activates embryonic development [@Sander1985-sg; @Garcia-Solache2010-lz].
We let embryos develop in deionized water at room temperature until the desired stage.
To remove the chorion, we transferred the embryos to a glass vial with 0.5x PBS using a fine brush, exchanged the medium for 5% bleach in 0.5x PBS for 2min, and washed abundantly with 0.5x PBS.
Using the diluted PBS solution instead of water prevents the embryos from bursting after dechorionation.

<!--TODO: Add width of petri dish-->

## Embryo fixation and *in situ* hybridization

For *Drosophila*, we transferred dechorionated embryos to a glass vial containing equal volumes of 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS and n-Heptane, and let the vial shaking at 215rpm for 45min.
After removing the fixative (lower phase) using a glass pipet, we added an equal volume of 100% methanol, and shook the vial vigorously by hand for 1min.
We then removed the n-Heptane (upper phase) and collected the embryos on the bottom to an eppendorf tube and washed several times with 100% methanol.
Samples were stored at -20°C.
For Clogmia, we used the same protocol, but diluted the fixative in 0.5x PBS.

We performed the *in situ* hybridization of *btd*, *eve*, *prd*, and *slp* genes in *Drosophila* and *Clogmia* using the Hybridization Chain Reaction v3.0 (HCR^TM^) [@Choi2018-fg] reagents, except for the probe sets, which we designed using a custom script.
The oligos were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich.
We selected the HCR^TM^ amplifiers to allow for triple (multiplexed) *in situ* combinations of *btd*+*eve*+*slp* or *prd*+*eve*+*slp*.
Before starting, we rehydrated the embryos in 100% methanol with a series of washes to 100% PBT.
We permeabilized *Clogmia* embryos with 1:5000 dilution of ProteinaseK (20 mg/mL) for 5min, but not *Drosophila* embryos.
All samples were re-fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 40min and washed thoroughly with PBT.
We then followed the *In situ HCR v3.0 protocol for whole-mount fruit fly embryos Revision 4 (2019-02-21)* from Molecular Instruments [molecularinstruments.com/hcr-rnafish-protocols](https://www.molecularinstruments.com/hcr-rnafish-protocols).
After the protocol, we stained the embryos with 1:1000 DAPI in 5x SSCT solution for 2h and mounted the embryos in 80% glycerol in 5x SSCT for imaging.

## Sample mounting for microscopy

For most of our live imaging, we used a Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope.
To increase the throughput of samples imaged in one session, we optimized a mounting strategy developed previously in our laboratory [@Schmied2016-oq].
First, we cut a 22x22mm glass coverslip (0.17mm thickness) into 6x15mm strips using a diamond knife, and attached a single strip to a custom sample holder using silicon glue, letting it harden for 15min.
We then coated the coverslip strip with a thin layer of heptane glue and let it dry while preparing the embryos.
Using a fine brush, we transferred the embryos collected in the cell strainer onto an agar pad, and oriented them manually with a blunt cactus spine under a stereomicroscope.
We aligned about 20 embryos in a single line (head to tail) along the main axis of the strip with the left or ventral sides up, depending on the experiment.
To attach the embryos to the coverslip, we carefully lowered the sample holder over the agar pad until the glass coated with heptane glue touched the embryos.
We placed the sample holder into the microscope chamber filled with water, and rotated it so that the samples are facing the detection objective directly, and the coverslip is orthogonal to the detection objective; this is important to prevent the lightsheet from hitting the glass edges.
With the embryos oriented vertically along the coverslip, the lightsheet generated from the illumination objectives coming from the sides only needs to pass through the width of the embryo (about 200µm).
This approach gives the best results for recording lateral and dorsal views and is ideal for live imaging homozygote embryos since they are only about one fourth of the total number of imaged embryos.
For fixed imaging of *in situ* samples we used an inverted Zeiss LSM 700 Confocal microscope.
We mounted the samples immersed in 80% glycerol between a slide and a glass coverslip supported by tape.

## Microscopy acquisition parameters

For the lightsheet lateral datasets, we used a Zeiss 20x/1NA Plan-Apochromat water immersion objective to acquire stacks with 0.28µm XY-resolution and 3µm Z-resolution covering half of the embryo’s volume in a single view.
This Z-resolution was restored to 1µm during image processing (see below).
For the dorsal datasets, we used a Zeiss 40x/1NA Plan-Apochromat water immersion objective to acquire stacks with 0.14µm XY-resolution and 3µm Z-resolution covering a volume around in the middle section of the anterior end of the embryo.
We adjusted the time resolution between 45--60s per frame to maximize the number of embryos acquired in one session.
To visualize both the membrane signal (mCherry) and the green balancer signal (GFP), we acquired two channels simultaneously using the 488 and 561nm lasers at 3% power with an image splitter cube containing a LP560 dichromatic mirror with SP550 and LP585 emission filters.
All live imaging recordings were performed at 25°C.
For the confocal datasets, we used a 20x/0.8 Plan-Apochromat Zeiss air objective to acquire 4-channels using 3 tracks (405nm, 488 and 639nm, and 555nm) with a BP575-640 emission filter and about 0.4µm XY-resolution and 2µm Z-resolution covering about half the embryo’s volume.

## Image processing and visualization

We converted the raw imaging datasets into individual TIFF stacks for downstream processing using a custom ImageJ macro in Fiji [@Schindelin2012-di; @Rueden2017-ky].
To visualize the presence and dynamics of ectopic folds, we generated 3D renderings of the surface of embryos in lateral recordings using the plugin 3Dscript in Fiji [@Schmid2019-bm].
For analyzing the entire epithelial surface, we first improved the signal-to-noise ratio and z-resolution of lateral datasets from 3µm to 1µm by training a deep learning upsampling model using CARE [@Weigert2018-ti].
Then, we created cartographic projections of the lateral recordings using the ImSAnE toolbox [@Heemskerk2015-kv] by loading the restored data in MATLAB [@Matlab2015-nd], segmenting the epithelial surface using ilastik [@Berg2019-ab], and generating 3D cartographic projections of lateral views following a workflow established for fly embryos [@Vellutini2022-ya].
To visualize *in situ* hybridization data, we performed maximum intensity projections or extracted single slices from the raw volumes.
For all microscopy images, we only performed minimal linear intensity adjustments to improve their contrast and brightness [@Schmied2020-ip].

## Ectopic fold analyses

To characterize the relative timing of ectopic folding, we annotated the germ band position and the number of frames after the onset of gastrulation at the initial buckling, when the first cells disappear from the surface in the lateral 3D renderings.
We defined the onset of gastrulation (T=0) as the moment immediately after the end of cellularization, and immediately before the beginning of the ventral furrow invagination.
To visualize the variability of ectopic folding, we manually traced the fold outlines in lateral recordings using Fiji.
Because embryos have different sizes, we first used the plugin *bUnwarpJ* [@Arganda-Carreras2006-im] ([imagej.net/plugins/bunwarpj](https://imagej.net/plugins/bunwarpj/)) to register individual frames and then applied the same transformation to the fold traces for a standardized comparison.
We analyzed the dynamics of ectopic folds by measuring the relative angle and tortuosity of the segmented line traces over time, and to visualize the kinetics we generated color-coded temporal projections using the script *Temporal Color Code* ([imagej.net/plugins/temporal-color-code](https://imagej.net/plugins/temporal-color-code)) with the perceptually uniform *mpl-viridis* color map ([bids.github.io/colormap](https://bids.github.io/colormap/)) bundled in Fiji.

To estimate the folded area in the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds, we annotated the region of the blastoderm before gastrulation that infolded in the cartographic projections using Fiji, and calculated the area correcting the pixel dimensions according to the coordinates in the projection.
For the fold depth, we measured the distance between the vitelline envelope to the tip of the fold at the moment of maximum depth in the dorsal recordings.
For the analysis of the epithelial surface, we used the plugin *MorphoLibJ* [@Legland2016-cp] ([imagej.net/plugins/morpholibj](https://imagej.net/plugins/morpholibj)) to segment, measure, and color-code the cell apical areas, and the plugin *Linear Stack Alignment with SIFT* ([imagej.net/plugins/linear-stack-alignment-with-sift](https://imagej.net/plugins/linear-stack-alignment-with-sift)) to register cells between timepoints.

## Laser cauterization experiments

We performed laser cauterization experiments in two microscope setups, a Luxendo MuVi SPIM with a photomanipulation module and a Zeiss LSM 780 NLO with multiphoton excitation.
For the MuVi SPIM, we embedded dechorionated embryos in 2% low-melting agarose and mounted the samples in glass capillaries to obtain *in toto* recordings.
We used a pulsed infrared laser 1030--1040nm with 200fs pulse duration and 1.5W power to cauterize the posterior region of the dorsal embryonic surface, attaching the blastoderm to the vitelline envelope.
Using a Olympus 20x/1.0NA water immersion objective, we acquired stacks with 0.29µm XY-resolution and 1µm Z-resolution of four different angles every one minute.
For the Zeiss microscope, we attached the embryos with the dorsal side down onto coverslips using heptane glue and immersing in halocarbon oil.
We cauterized the embryos sequentially using a near infrared 800nm laser (Chameleon Vision II) through a single pixel line (210nm/px and 100µs/px) around the same dorsal region to block the germ band extension.
We used a Zeiss 25x/0.8NA LD LCI Plan-Apochromat glycerol immersion objective to acquire every 2:38min two different planes of the blastoderm, (i) the surface to monitor the germ band extension, and (ii) 40µm deep in the equatorial region to monitor the occurrence of ectopic folding.
The stacks had 0.21µm XY-resolution and one minute time resolution.
To obtain a quantitative measure of ectopic folding, we analyzed the degree by which the tissues deform between non-cauterized and cauterized mutants using as a proxy the tortuosity of the epithelium outline.
For that, we took the profile slices from dorsal recordings and transformed the curved vitelline envelope into a straight line using the *Straighten* tool of ImageJ ({@fig:tortuosity}a).
We then cropped a 200×25µm region along the head--trunk interface and applied gaussian blur, thresholding, and edge detection to obtain the epithelium outline for individual timepoints covering about 50min after gastrulation ({@fig:tortuosity}a,b).
We extracted measurements from the epithelium outlines using the ImageJ plugin *Analyze Skeleton* [@Arganda-Carreras2010-la] ([imagej.net/plugins/analyze-skeleton](https://imagej.net/plugins/analyze-skeleton/)), and generated the color-coded temporal projections as described above.

<!--TODO: Temperature in MuVi and Zeiss?-->

## Laser ablation experiments

We performed laser ablations in a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal spinning disk, an EMCCD camera (Andor iXon DU-888), and the software AndorIQ for image acquisition.
We attached dechorionated embryos laterally to a MatTek glass-bottom petri dish and covered the samples with water, and performed the ablations using a Titanium Sapphire Chameleon Ultra II (Coherent) laser at 800nm tuned down from 80MHz to 20kHz with a pulse-picker.
The laser power measured before the microscope port was 6 mW and the pixel dwell time for scanning was 2µs.
To ensure the cut, we repeated the scan ten consecutive times along a single cell acquiring a single slice with a 60x/1.2NA water immersion objective with 0.18µm XY-resolution and 200ms time-steps.
We ablated each embryo just once.
The temperature was maintained at 28°C.
To analyze the ablation data, we created a line crossing the edges of the ablated cell perpendicular to the cut and generated a kymograph using the *Multi Kymograph* Fiji plugin ({@fig:ablation}).
We then binarized the kymographs, measured the distance between cell edges over the first 30s after the cut, and performed a linear fit of the data to obtain the recoil velocity ({@fig:ablation}).

<!--TODO: What is the brand of the objective?-->
<!--TODO: Does a higher temperature affects the quantifications?-->

## Strain rate analysis

To estimate the strain rates, we first performed particle image velocimetry on cartographic projections using the ImageJ plugin *iterativePIV* [@Tseng2012-ni] ([sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/piv](https://sites.google.com/site/qingzongtseng/piv)).
Then, we used the equation $$E = \left| \frac{1}{2} \left( \vec \nabla . \vec v \right) + \frac{1}{2} \left( \partial_x v_y + \partial_y v_x \right) \right|$$ to define and calculate the magnitude of the strain rate, where $v$ is the displacement obtained in the PIV divided by the time in minutes.
The measurements combine isotropic and anisotropic strain rate.
We used these values to create a color-coded overlay for the strain rate ({@fig:apical-strain}b).
To generate the line plots, we averaged the strain rate along the dorsoventral axis in two pre-defined regions, the head--trunk (canonical cephalic furrow position) and the trunk--germ (posterior to the Mitotic Domain 6) ({@fig:apical-strain}b).

## Model and simulations

Our model follows an approach similar to a previously published model of epithelial buckling under confinement [@Trushko2020-gf].
It represents the monolayer epithelium of the early *Drosophila* embryo in a cross section as a single line through the apical--basal midline of the epithelial cells.
The tissue is modeled as an elastic rod with a stretching energy per unit length $W_s$ and bending energy per unit length $W_b$, so that the total energy per unit length is $W_T = W_s + W_b$.
In full, $$W_T = \int_{L_o} \frac{1}{2} K_s \left( \frac{ds}{ds_o} - 1 \right)^2 ds_o + \int_{L_o} \frac{1}{2} K_b \left( \kappa - \kappa_o \right)^2 ds_o$$ where $K_s$ is the stretching rigidity and $K_b$ is the bending rigidity of the tissue; $ds_o$ and $ds$ are the preferred and current lengths of the curve, respectively; and $\kappa$ is the curvature of the rod.
$L_o$ is the total length of the tissue in a stress-free condition.
To perform numerics, we discretize the curve into $N$ particles indexed by $i$.
The total energy per unit length for this discretized model is given by 
$$W_T^{\text{*}} = \frac{1}{2} K_s \sum_{i = 2}^{N-3} \left( \frac{\Delta r_i}{\Delta r_o} - 1 \right)^2 \Delta r_o + \frac{1}{2} K_b \sum_{i = 2}^{N-3} \left( \kappa_i - \kappa_{o,i} \right)^2 \Delta r_o$$ where $\Delta r_o$ is the preferred length of springs connecting consecutive points (equal for all springs); $\Delta r_i$ is the current length between $i$ and $i+1$; $\kappa_i$ is the discretized curvature at point $i$; $\kappa_{o,i}$ is the preferred curvature at point $i$ (equal to 0, except when specified).
The first and last two points of the curve are fixed in space.
To obtain a physically meaningful dimensionless bending rigidity, we divide the bending rigidity by the factor $K_sL^2$ as $$K_{b}^{\text{*}} = \frac{K_b}{K_sL^2}$$ where $L$ is the semi-major axis of the embryo.
To minimize the total energy, we add a ground level of noise to the particles and let the particles move in the direction of the forces.
The motion of the particles are governed by $$\frac{\Delta\underline{r}_i}{\Delta t} = - \frac{L}{K_s\tau}\frac{\partial W^{\text{*}}}{\partial \underline{r}_i} + \underline{\zeta}_i$$ where $\underline{r}_i$ is the current position of the $i$th particle; $\tau$ represents an arbitrary timescale introduced here to balance dimensions (set to 1); $\Delta t$ are the timesteps (set to $10^{-5} \times \tau K_s/L$); and $\underline{\zeta}_i$ is the noise, chosen from a gaussian distribution with mean 0 and standard distribution $10^{-5}\times L$.
In our model the position of the germ band corresponds to the position of the last particle in the curve on the semi-ellipse that represents the embryonic blastoderm.
The extent of the germ band is given by $g$ which is the projection of the germ band arclength onto the mid-axis of the embryo normalized by the embryo length ($2L$).
When $g=0$ the tissue is free of stretching stress, but at any other $0<g<1$, the blastoderm will be compressed.
The preferred lengths of the individual springs is obtained by dividing the elliptical arclength into $N$ equal segments.
The length of each segment is given by $\Delta r_{\text{o}} = \frac{1}{N} \left( L\int_{0}^{\pi} \sqrt{1 - e^2 \cos^2(u)} du \right)$. 
To find the initial lengths of the springs, we use $$\Delta r(t = 0) = \frac{1}{N} \left( L\int_{u'}^{\pi} \sqrt{1 - e^2 \cos^2(u)} du \right)$$ where $e = \sqrt{1 - {(0.4)}^{2}}$; and the angle $u'$ corresponds to the position of the blastoderm end. $u'$ is obtained for a given value of $g$ by $u' = \cos^{-1}(1 - 2g)$.
Here, we obtained the initial lengths by dividing the compressed blastoderm into $N$ equal segments.
For any simulation, the value of $g$ is constant (blastoderm end is static in position).
To model mitotic domains, we introduced new particles and springs on the mid-points between two particles in specific regions of length $0.5L$.
The new springs are given the same $\Delta r_{o}$ as the rest of the springs in the tissue.
The blastoderm is confined by a rigid boundary in the shape of a semi-ellipse.
Any particle that lands outside this boundary at any timestep is re-positioned onto the rigid boundary.
This new position is prescribed by taking the intersection point of the rigid boundary curve and the line segment that connects the position before this iteration (which was inside or on the vitelline envelope) and the position outside the vitelline envelope.
Finally, we define and count a *fold* when we find that a particle's distance from the rigid boundary is greater than a threshold value.
To calculate this threshold, we measure the maximum distance that particles can achieve when the tissue is in a stress-free state.
This threshold was calculated to be $0.035L$.
The code for the model and simulations is available in a Zenodo repository [@Krishna2023-hu].

## Data visualization and figure assembly

The high-resolution figures and videos are available in a Zenodo repository [@Vellutini2023-ix].
We performed the data wrangling, statistical analyses, and plotting in R v4.2.1 [@R-Core-Team1993-jw] using RStudio v2022.7.2.576 [@RStudio-Team2011-vj], and Python 3.10.7 using Jupyter notebooks [@Granger2021-zg].

## Figure 1

![Formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants.
**a**, Overview of key developmental events using a standard developmental staging [@Ashburner2005-ym]. The formation of the cephalic furrow is delayed in *prd* mutants and absent in *btd* and *eve* mutants. In the latter, ectopic folds form near the canonical invagination site of the cephalic furrow. Wildtype and *prd* embryos form less frequent and smaller ectopic folds more anterior or posterior to the cephalic furrow. Ectopic folds appear later and unfold quicker than the cephalic furrow, and their formation coincides with the appearance of mitotic domains and with the rapid phase of the germ band extension [@Campos-Ortega1985-ma].
**b**, Profile view of wildtype and *prd* embryos (early stage 8), and *btd* and *eve* embryos (late stage 8) showing the divergent morphology of the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds, respectively. Membrane marker = Gap43-mCherry. Scale bars = 20µm.
**c**, Lateral view of sibling controls (heterozygotes) and mutant embryos (*btd* or *eve* homozygotes). The arrows indicate epithelial folds, the asterisks indicate the position of mitotic domains, and the percentages indicate the extent of germ band extension relative to the egg length. Membrane marker = Gap43-mCherry. Scale bars = 50µm.
**d**, Timing of formation of cephalic furrow and ectopic folds in different genetic backgrounds. The cephalic furrow forms about 7 minutes after gastrulation in wildtype (+/+, n=16) and *btd* heterozygotes (+/−, n=6), and is delayed in *eve* and *prd* heterozygotes (+/−, n=7 and n=10, respectively) and in *prd* homozygotes (−/−, n=5). Ectopic folds form about 20min after gastrulation in *btd* and *eve* homozygotes (−/−, n=5 and n=5, respectively). One dot represents one embryo.
**e**, Percentage of germ band extension at the time of formation of the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds in different genetic backgrounds. The cephalic furrow appears at 10% germ band extension, except in *prd* heterozygotes where it varies up to 40%. Ectopic folds form at 30--35% germ band extension. The n values are the same as in **d**.
**f**, Variability in the distribution of the cephalic furrow in sibling controls (*btd* heterozygotes) and of the ectopic folds in *btd* mutants (n=6). Scale bars = 50µm.
**g**, Folded area of the cephalic furrow (CF) and ectopic folds (EF) in *btd* embryos. The folded region is outlined in yellow on cartographic projections of a representative sibling control *btd* heterozygote (left) and of a *btd* homozygote (right). The numbers indicate the average folded area for the sample type in µm^2^×10^3^.
**h**, Quantification of the total folded area of epithelial surface in cephalic furrow mutants.

![Coincidence of mitotic domains and germ band extension with ectopic folding.
**a**, Position of ectopic folds (black lines) in relation to the mitotic domains (colored areas) in *btd* and *eve* mutants. The ectopic folds appear between mitotic domains and between the germ band and the mitotic domain 6 (MD6). Scale bars = 50µm.
**b**, Apical cell area between mitotic domains MD5 and MD7/6 (top). The infolded area is highlighted in the last frame (4.6 min). Detail of a cell subset in between mitotic domains (bottom) showing non-dividing cells (orange) and adjacent dividing cells (blue). Scale bars = 20µm (this is an approximate value because the pixel resolutions vary across the projection).
**c**, Ectopic folding forming between MD6 and the germ band in a *btd* mutant. The mitotic expansion (double arrouw) precedes the ectopic folding (arrow). Scale bar = 20µm.
**d**, Comparison between the timing of cephalic furrow formation (CF), mitotic domain expansion (MD), and ectopic folding (EF) in wildtype and cephalic furrow mutants (*btd* and *eve* combined). In wildtype and heterozygote embryos, the cephalic furrow forms before mitotic domains, while in homozygote embryos, the ectopic folds form after mitotic domains.
**e**, Compressed epithelial cells between MD6 and the tip of the germ band. Scale bars = 50µm.
**f**, Strain rate analysis at the head--trunk (top) and trunk--germ (bottom) regions. The formation of the cephalic furrow (CF), ectopic folds (EF), and mitotic domains (MD) are annotated. The measurements combine isotropic and anisotropic strain rate.
**g**, Tissue dynamics at the trunk--germ boundary after laser ablations. We measured the distance between cell vertex pairs over time in control and ablated wildtype embryos. The tracks are color-coded for time. Solid white line represents the distance between vertices at one timepoint. Dashed white line shows the location of the cut. The plots show a smoothed local regression of three samples.

**a**, Region of interest of the model. One side of a frontal slice across a slightly dorsal plane of the embryonic blastoderm. It follows the embryo shape, its proportions, and the relative positions of mitotic domains, cephalic furrow, and germ band.
**b**, Characteristics of the individual components of the model based on particles connected by springs. The drawings exemplify the initial and final states for each component.
**c**, Energy equation with a stretching and a bending component, and the dimensionless bending rigidity. Stress-free rod length ($L_o$), total energy per unit length ($W_T$), stretching energy per unit length ($W_s$), bending energy per unit length ($W_b$), stretching rigidity ($K_s$), bending rigidity ($K_b$), preferred spring length ($ds_o$), current spring length ($ds$), preferred curvature ($\kappa_o$), current curvature ($\kappa$), semi-major embryonic axis ($L$).
**d**, Plots showing the energy dynamics across iterations in a typical simulation run. The total energy goes down to equilibrium. The bending energy increases drastically reaching a peak (blue dashed line) that diminishes gradually with the iterations. Energy values are normalized by the initial total energy. The number of folds stabilizes when the bending energy peaks but the fold depth continues to increase until the last iteration (pink dashed line).
**e**, Mutant parameter sweep without mitotic domains (no cephalic furrow). The heatmap shows the average number of ectopic folds for different bending rigidities and percentages of germ band extension. Ectopic folding frequency increases with lower bending rigidities (softer tissue) and with greater values of germ band extension. Outlined in white is the baseline condition with neither mitotic domains nor germ band but only ground level noise (i), and the germ band only condition with higher number of folding events (ii). Representative simulations are shown below.
**f**, Mutant parameter sweep with mitotic domains (no cephalic furrow). The phase diagram shows an increase in number of folds in relation to **e**. The addition of mitotic domains induces the formation of ectopic folds even without germ band extension (iii). Representative simulations are shown below.
**g**, Quantification of ectopic folding to evaluate the effectiveness of the cephalic furrow. The top row shows a control simulating a cephalic furrow mutant condition with mitotic domains and germ band extension. The middle row shows an active cephalic furrow invagination with mitotic domains forming at the same time without delay. The bottom row shows the cephalic furrow with a delay in mitotic domain formation ($t_{MD}=5$). $t_{MD}=1$ corresponds to 10^5^ computational timesteps.
**h**, Quantification of ectopic folding with variable cephalic furrow positioning.

![Perturbation experiments *in vivo* using cephalic furrow mutants and wildtype embryos.
**a**, Lateral view of *btd*--*stg* double mutants showing the absence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary compared to a *btd* mutant. Scale bar = 50µm.
**b**, Profile view of a *btd*--*stg* double mutant showing the head--trunk epithelium without mitotic domains or ectopic folds. Scale bar = 20µm.
**c**, Cauterized *eve* mutant in lateral (top) and dorsal view (bottom) at the maximum apical expansion of dividing cells in mitotic domains. The cauterization site is marked by a vermilion circle. The boxed outline (right) shows the progressive expansion of mitotic domains compressing the non-dividing cells between MD1 and MD5. Scale bars = 50µm.
**d** Profile view and epithelial trace of non-cauterized and cauterized *btd* and *eve* embryos. The trace shows the dynamics of epithelial deformations over time colored from purple to yellow. Cauterized mutants show no ectopic folds and less deformation of the epithelium. Scale bars = 20µm.
**e**, Cauterized wildtype embryo in lateral (top) and dorsal view (bottom). The cauterization site is marked by a vermilion circle. The cephalic furrow invaginates normally. Scale bar = 50µm.
**f**, Profile view of a non-cauterized and a cauterized wildtype embryo showing a small difference in depth. Scale bar = 20µm.
**g**, Tortuosity of the epithelial traces in non-cauterized (*btd* n=2, *eve* n=3) and cauterized (*btd* n=3, *eve* n=4) embryos from **d**. For each embryo, the left and right side were measured.
**h**, Maximum depth of the cephalic furrow in cauterized embryos. Control non-cauterized embryos include wildtype (n=2), and *btd* (n=1) and *eve* (n=3) heterozygotes which also form a cephalic furrow. The cauterized group includes wildtype (n=2) and *btd* (n=1). The cephalic furrow in cauterized embryos is 15% shallower (p=0.0221 in Welch Two Sample t-test).
**i**, Recoil velocity of laser ablations around the cephalic furrow at stage 6. The average recoil increases with time for anterior cuts (early n=11, mid n=13, late n=12), and reaches a peak at mid stage 6 for posterior cuts (early n=7, mid n=14, late n=10). The average recoil velocity is smaller at greater distances (−40 and 40) than at shorter distances (−20 and 20) from the initiator cells. In late stage 6 the region with recoil reaches at least 40µm anterior and posterior of the invagination.
**j**, Schematic drawings showing the summary of the ectopic folding in double mutants and germ band cauterization experiments. Tissue flows are represented by black arrows, mitotic domains (MD) by light gray patches, and the cephalic furrow (CF) area by a dark gray band. In cephalic furrow mutants the excess of epithelial tissue on the surface, combined with the formation of mitotic domains and the extension of the germ band (GB), leads to mechanical instabilities and the buckling of ectopic folds (EF) at the head--trunk boundary.

**a**, Lateral view of *slp* mutant heterozygote (control) and mutant embryo at the onset of initiator cell behavior. In *slp* mutants, the cephalic furrow formation is delayed; it happens when the germ band is extended about 18% of egg length. The position of intiation is shifted forward in mutants at about 73% of egg length. The asterisk indicates mitotic cells. Scale bars = 50µm.
**b**, Plots showing the position of the cephalic furrow (CF) and germ band (GB) at the onset of initiator cell behavior in *slp* mutants.
**c**, Lateral view of *slp* mutants in *Drosophila* embryos showing the expression of *btd* and *eve*. The distance between *eve* stripe 1 and 2 is larger in *slp* embryos. The asterisk indicates a region between the acron (ac) and head--trunk (ht) domains of *btd* where its expression is activated (or de-repressed) in the absence of the *slp* head domain (sh). Scale bars = 50µm.
**d**, Dorsal view showing the ectopic expression of *btd* (asterisks) and anterior shift of *btd*--*eve* overlap in *slp* mutants. Scale bars = 20µm.
**e**, Profile view showing the increased number of cell rows between *eve* stripe 1 and 2 in *slp* mutants. Scale bars = 20µm.
**f**, Progression of the early expression of *btd*, *eve*, and *slp* around the mitotic cycle 14 in *Drosophila* and *Clogmia*. Initially, *slp* and *eve* demarcate the head--trunk boundary of both species in broad domains that later become segmented. The head--trunk domain of *btd* is expressed early in *Drosophila* but is absent in *Clogmia*. The anterior domain of *btd* is present in both species, but is only activated in *Drosophila* at the onset of gastrulation.
**g**, Crop showing the narrowing and sharpening of the expression domains in *Drosophila*. *slp1* and *eve* expression domains are complementary and *btd* is expressed at this interface. The border between *slp1* and *eve* resolve into sharp, non-overlapping stripes. The overlap between *btd* and *eve* narrows progressively until resolving to a 1-cell row. Dashed lines mark the future edges of the cephalic furrow.
**h**, Close-up of the anterior region showing the absence of a *btd* head--trunk domain in *Clogmia* compared to *Drosophila*.
**i**, Comparison of gene expression patterns at the onset of gastrulation. In *Drosophila*, *slp1* stripes demarcate the outer edges of the cephalic furrow (dashed lines) and the 1--2-cell wide *eve*-expressing row is abutted anteriorly and posteriorly by non-overlapping 2-cell wide *slp1* stripes. The expression pattern of *slp* and *eve* in *Clogmia* is very similar to *Drosophila*. The main difference is the absence of the head--trunk domain of *btd* in *Clogmia*. Dashed lines in *Clogmia* mark the *slp* stripes homologous to *Drosophila*.

## Figure 6

![Interplay of genetics and mechanics during cephalic furrow evolution.
**a**, Simplified dipteran phylogeny based on [@Wiegmann2011-ou] with cephalic furrow traits mapped onto the tree. Combined data from this study and Dey *et al.* [@Dey2023-mo] (indicated in the figure). The germ band extension and mitotic domains are ancestral, suggesting that compressive stresses at the head--trunk boundary were present since the dawn of Diptera. The cephalic furrow is derived trait, an evolutionary novelty of cyclorraphan flies [@Dey2023-mo]. It is absent in *Clogmia* [@Jimenez-Guri2014-zs] and *Chironomus* [@Caroti2015-cy], but present in the common ancestor of *Megaselia* [@Wotton2014-fr] and *Drosophila*. Out-of-plane cell divisions at the head--trunk boundary are present in *Clogmia* and *Chironomus* [@Dey2023-mo]. They could be an ancestral trait together with mitotic domains and the long germ. *Clogmia* lacks a head--trunk domain of *btd* (this study). In *Chironomus* *btd* is expressed in the lateral side, but does not overlap with *eve* stripe 1 [@Dey2023-mo]. Therefore, *btd*--*eve* overlap correlates with the presence of the cephalic furrow, and may be associated with its evolution.
**b**, Scenario for mechanical instability as a selective pressure for the evolution of morphogenetic innovations. In the ancestral state there was no mechanical instability at the head--trunk boundary (0). The appearance of mitotic domains and germ band extension increased the compressive stresses and ectopic buckling events at the head--trunk boundary (1). This mechanical instability may have had a detrimental effect on individual fitness by affecting developmental robustness or by slowing down embryogenesis. Natural selection favored the establishment of patterned processes that mitigate these compressive stresses at the head--trunk boundary. One solution, present in *Clogmia* and *Chironomus*, is the out-of-plane cell divisions which reduce the compression load on the monolayer epithelium (2a). Another solution, present in *Drosophila* and other cyclorraphan flies, is the formation of an out-of-plane invagination which absorbs the mechanical forces at the head--trunk boundary (2b). These events may have happened through the stabilization of genetic interactions and cooption of existing signaling modules controlling cell and tissue morphogenesis. Tissue mechanics may have been an important factor influencing the evolution of patterned morphogenesis in early embryonic development.

In *btd* mutants (bottom), no invagination initiates but some embryos exhibit a bulging of the epithelium due to a residual apical constriction behavior (about 7min). An ectopic fold forms at this position. Its morphology differs greatly from the cephalic furrow (see 10min). Both the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds regress with the extension of the germ band.

## Extended Data Fig. 1

![Perturbation of the initiator cell behavior in cephalic furrow mutants.
**a**, Profile view showing the cephalic furrow formation in wildtype, *prd*, *btd*, and *eve* embryos. The samples are synchronized by the end of cellularization, when the cleavage furrows reach their basal position (frame 0.0min). The arrow indicates the position and timing of the first infolding of the tissue. In wildtype, the shortening of initiator cells begins before cellularization is complete. The apical side of adjacent cells remain in close contact to the initiator row becoming arched in an arrangement typical for the early phase of cephalic furrow formation (wildtype 0.0min). This arrangement is perturbed in mutant embryos to different degrees. In *prd*, the initiator cells shorten and the tissue invaginates, but the infolding is delayed and the adjacent cells do not arch over the initiator row (*prd* 6.1min). In *btd*, there is no cell shortening but some embryos exhibit a certain degree of anisotropic apical constriction which creates a bulge in the epithelium minutes after the end of cellularization (*btd* 6.0min, see also **b**). This initial bulge often primes the position of ectopic buckling. In *eve*, the cells show neither shortening nor apical constriction and ectopic folds appear about ten minutes after the end of cellularization (*eve* 9.7min). Scale bars = 20µm.
**b**, Surface view view of cartographic projections showing the head--trunk interface. In wildtype, the anisotropic apical constriction is localized to a narrow stripe adjacent to the initiator row. In *prd* embryos, the apical constriction occurs but it does not form a clear line of infolding cells preceding the invagination as in wildtype embryos. In *btd* embryos, there is a similar degree of anisotropic apical constriction occurring but not all embryos form ectopic folds at this region. In *eve* embryos, the mitotic domain 2 (MD) begins expanding and there is no apical constriction behavior. Time betwee frames is about 4min. Scale bars = 20µm (approximate value).

**d**, Dynamics of cephalic furrow and ectopic fold formation in *eve* mutants.
**e**, Dynamics, angle directionality, and tortuosity measurements comparing the cephalic furrow and ectopic fold formation. Within the first fifteen minutes after gastrulation, the cephalic furrow exhibits a typical posterior shift on the dorsal side which declines the initial angle of the invagination from 80° to about 60° in relation to the anteroposterior axis. During this period, the invagination begins as a straight line and bends showing a correspondent increase in the measured tortuosity values of the furrow outline. In contrast, ectopic folds show no obvious trend in angular direction tortuosity values over time. For both angle and tortuosity analysis, n=6.
**f**, Maximum folding depth of the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants. Ectopic folds are shallower than the cephalic furrow in both genetic backgrounds (*btd* p=1.278e-09 and *eve* p=9.728e-05 in a Welch Two Sample t-test). Each dot corresponds to a single fold; each embryo can have multiple folds. The number of embryos analyzed for *btd* is 22 heterozygotes and 6 homozygotes, and for *eve* is 14 heterozygotes and 4 homozygotes.
**g**, Folded area of ectopic folds in wildtype and mutant embryos (*btd*, *eve*, and *prd*). Ectopic folds in wildtype occupy a smaller area than ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants (p=9.107e-06 in a Wilcoxon rank sum exact test).

![Characterization of the model features.
**a**, Embryonic proportions in wildtype and cephalic furrow mutants. Approximate relative sizes and positions between embryonic features such as mitotic domains, folds, and the germ band. All values are relative to the embryo length. We used these dimensions as a reference for creating the model.
**b**, Representative simulation using $K_{b}^{\text{*}}=7 \times 10^{-5}$ and $g=0.3$ showing the shape of the tissue at $t=19$ (blue) and $t=1000$ (pink). The respective timepoints are marked in dashed lines in the descriptive plots below. They show the variation in total energy, bending energy, number of folds, and fold depth over the iterations. $t=1$ corresponds to $10^{5}$ computational steps and the X axis is in $log_{10}$ scale to improve the visualization.
**c--e**, Parameter sweep without mitotic domains. Plots show (**c**) the number of folds by bending rigidity $K_{b}^{\text{*}}$ using $g=0.3$, (**d**) the number of folds by germ band extension ($g$) using $K_{b}^{\text{*}}=1.0 \times 10^{-4}$, and (**e**) the timing of folding by germ band extension ($g$) using $K_{b}^{\text{*}}=1.0 \times 10^{-4}$ (right).
**f--h**, Parameter sweep with mitotic domains and same plots as above.
**i**, Parameter sweep for cephalic furrow simulations. Bending rigidity and cephalic furrow depth at different values of $\kappa_o^{CF}$ and germ band extension. Values above 0.2 exhibit a clear peak in bending energy for most conditions and the depth reaches a plateau across iterations. The cephalic furrow depth at the peak of bending energy (max bend) and at the final iteration is similar for simulations with 0% of germ band extension. At higher percentages of germ band extension the folds (both cephalic furrow and ectopic folds) exhibit a greater depth at the last iteration.
**j**, Finer-grained parameter sweep of ectopic folding without ($t_{MD}=0$) and with ($t_{MD}=5$) a delay in cephalic furrow formation. With simultaneous formation, only higher values of $\kappa_o^{CF}$ are effective in buffering the formation of ectopic folds around the cephalic furrow region. This is also limited to low percentages of germ band extension since at higher percentages there is an increase in the frequency of ectopic folding. When a delay in mitotic formation is present, even low values of $\kappa_o^{CF}$ are effective in preventing the formation of ectopic folds. In this condition, the extension of the germ band increases the formation of ectopic folds, but only at the posterior regions close to the germ band tip. This suggests that the initiation of the cephalic furrow is crucial to its ability to buffer the ectopic folding. Values of $\kappa_o^{CF}$ are shown in units of $1/L$. $t_{MD}=1$ corresponds to 10^5^ computational timesteps.
**k**, Representative simulations in **g** at 0 and 20% germ band extension.

![Additional *in vivo* experiments in cephalic furrow mutants.
**a**, Lateral 3D renderings of *stg* mutant embryos. *stg* homozygotes show no cell divisions after gastrulation but the early morphogenetic movements of gastrulation occur normally. Asterisks indicate mitotic domains. The cephalic furrow forms without delays and exhibits a similar dynamics of invagination compared to wildtype embryos. The only noticeable difference is that the dorsal portion does not shift as posteriorly as in sibling controls, which could be due to the absence of mitotic domains in the head. Scale bar = 50µm.
**b**, Optical slice of profile views. The initiator cell behaviors are not perturbed in *stg* mutants and the morphology of the invagination is intact. In fact, because of the lack of cell divisions, the epithelium remains more uniform during gastrulation when compared to sibling controls or wildtype embryos. Scale bar = 20µm.

### Comparing our reference bending rigidity to direct measurements

<!--TODO: Revise this text-->

The goal is to compare the reference bending rigidity that we estimate for the *Drosophila* blastoderm with a direct measurement from the literature.
Trushko et al. [@Trushko2020-gf] reports that in a MDCK monolayer $K_b = 5\times10^{-13} Nm$ and $K_s = 0.15 Nm^{-1}$.
With these values we can compute the dimensionless bending rigidity $K_b^*$.
However, the thickness of the MDCK monolayer and the *Drosophila* blastoderm are very different, and hence we need to correct for this before computing $K_b^*$ for MDCK monolayer. 
The bending rigidity scales with square of the thickness of the tissue.
Hence the corrected $K_b$ can be computed as $K_b^{'} = K_b^*(h_{blastoderm}/h_{MDCK})^2$.
This gives us $K_b^{'} =2\times10^{-12} Nm$.
Now we can compute $K_b^* = K_b^{'}/K_s L^2$ where we put $L = 255\mu m$.
Here we scale $K_b^{'}/K_s$ by the relevant lengthscale which is the semi-major axis of the Drosophila embryo.
This gives us $K_b^* = 2.05\times 10^{-4}$.
This is the estimated $K_b^*$ for the MDCK monolayer that has the same thickness as the *Drosophila* blastoderm (referring to the height correction) and has been put in the same geometrical conditions as the *Drosophila* blastoderm (referring to the $L$ used in the calculation).

### Live-imaging screen for cephalic furrow genes

<!--TODO: Add figure with screen outline-->
<!--TODO: Add table with candidate genes-->
<!--TODO: Add table with screen results-->
<!--TODO: Add figure with screen results-->

To uncover other genes directly involved in cephalic furrow formation in addition to *btd*, *eve*, and *prd*, we performed a live-imaging screen in strains containing loss-of-function alleles for a selection of candidate genes expressed at the head--trunk region [@Tomancak2002-yf; @Tomancak2007-db; @Lecuyer2007-uy].
Because the cephalic furrow is transient and leaves no trace, the live-imaging approach is critical to recognize altered phenotypes.
From about 50 genes, we only detected three showing abnormal cephalic furrow formation to different degrees besides the previously described genes (see @tbl:screen).
The strongest cephalic furrow phenotype was present in flies mutant for the *sloppy paired* (*slp*) genes.

## Supplementary Method 1

![Image processing pipeline for the tortuosity analysis in cauterized mutants.
**a**, We acquired a single slice in profile view of the head--trunk epithelium. First, we straightened the epithelial monolayer along the curvature of the vitelline envelope using the Straighten tool in ImageJ. We then cropped a window to standardize the size of the analyzed area for all embryos.
**b**, Then, we applied a gaussian blur which allows to capture the deformations in the epithelium caused by the ectopic folds after thresholding. We create a mask and detect edges and invert to retain a single pixel line corresponding to the outline of the epithelium. The image is inverted for downstream processing.
**c**, We applied a temporal color-coded projections to visualize the epithelial dynamics over time, and created a montage with all timepoints to extract the length of the outline using the skeletonize plugin in ImageJ.
