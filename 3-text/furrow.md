# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. Despite being a prominent
embryonic landmark, the role of the cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we
investigate how defects in cephalic furrow formation impact gastrulation
dynamics by live-imaging mutant embryos under lightsheet microscopy. We observe
that when the cephalic furrow is absent, the tissues at the head--trunk
interface become uneven and form erratic epithelial folds. We show these
ectopic folds are the result of mechanical pressure between head and trunk
tissues, generated by the concomitant expansion of mitotic domains in the head
and extension of the germ band in the trunk. We thus propose that, by priming
the position of folding and storing epithelia out-of-plane, the cephalic furrow
counteracts and buffers these opposing physical interactions preventing
epithelial instability at the head--trunk boundary during gastrulation.

<!--Other movements have a clear role; the cephalic furrow not so.-->

# Introduction

<!--The importance of the head--trunk boundary-->

- Head--trunk boundary in bilaterian evolution
- In Drosophila it is demarcated by the cephalic furrow 
- Cephalic furrow is a prominent but mysterious anatomical landmark

<!--The preciseness of cephalic furrow formation-->

- First morphogenetic movement of gastrulation
- Bilateral indentations initiated by a single row of cells
- Specification of initiator cells is determined genetically
- Zygotic expression of btd/eve in overlapping cells
- Undergo coordinated series of cell shape changes
- Driven by lateral myosin contractility
- Quickly invaginate deep into the yolk sac
- Mechanical coupling mechanisms ensure the fold precision
- While the invagination extends across the DV axis
- Processes show outstanding 1% accuracy
- Integration of precise developmental mechanisms for CF formation

<!--The lack of understanding about its role-->

- Unclear, however, what is the role of the cephalic furrow
- Because is a transient structure that vanishes in hours
- And not associated to specific tissue fates such as mesoderm/endoderm
- In silico proposed a barrier or a mechanical role
- But this hypothesis and CF interactions have not been studied in vivo

<!--The approach we took to investigate-->







<!--Bilaterian developmental novelties-->
The evolution of a bilaterally symmetrical body established a new paradigm in
animal development. A key invention of bilaterians is the developmental and
functional separation between anterior and posterior body regions. Therefore a
fundamental step in bilaterian development is defining the cells and tissues
will become the head and the trunk of the animal. The head--trunk boundary is
thus an ancient and fundamental trait of bilaterians.
<!--Head--trunk boundary is important-->

<!--Head--trunk boundary in Drosophila is demarcated by the cephalic furrow-->

<!--The cephalic furrow remains the least understood morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation. -->

<!--Its transient nature makes the cephalic furrow particularly challenging to investigate, and partly the reason why only a few mutants have been identified. -->

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that forms in the gastrulating
*Drosophila* embryo. It is one of the first morphogenetic movements in the
embryo initiating at the onset of gastrulation together with the ventral
furrow. The cephalic furrow begins as lateral indentations that invaginate deep
into the yolk sac, extending completely to the dorsal and ventral sides in a
matter of minutes [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw].

The structure demarcates a major landmark in the embryo, the position between
the procephalon and the germ band, or in other words, the head--trunk boundary
of *Drosophila*.

<!--Cephalic furrow formation is stereotypic and controlled genetically-->

Cephalic furrow formation is controlled genetically. Its position is specified
by the zygotic expression of *buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*)
stripe 1 [@Vincent1997-fa], with 1% accuracy along the body length
[@Liu2013-lc]. The specified initiator cells then undergo a coordinated series
of cell shape changes [@Spencer2015-td] driven by lateral myosin contractility
[@Eritano2020-mi], which triggers the infolding of epithelial cells below the
basal lamina, while mechanical coupling mechanisms between epithelial cells
ensure the precision of the fold. Thus, flies evolved precise developmental
mechanisms in place to initiate and drive cephalic furrow formation at the
onset of gastrulation.

<!--Developmental mechanisms are in place for formation-->

<!--Enigmatic because transient and leaves no trace-->
Despite the patterning and morphogenesis being under genetic control, and
demarcating a significant anatomical landmark of the body, the role of the
cephalic furrow remains enigmatic. Unlike the ventral furrow, the invaginated
cells of the cephalic furrow do not give rise to any particular tissue in the
embryo. More intriguingly, the cephalic furrow is transient and unfolds and
vanishes entirely after gastrulation leaving no morphological traces
[@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa]. This raises the question whether the
cephalic furrow might play a physical role during gastrulation.
<!--Might have a physical rather than regulatory role-->

<!--Approach of this study-->
Here we investigate this hypothesis by analyzing how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impact the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary and
the global dynamics of gastrulation.

<!--Summary of findings-->
We find that when the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, the epithelia at the
head--trunk interface shows unpredictable deformations and buckling events. We
show the tissue buckling is the result of mechanical forces acting on the
monolayer epithelia and is influenced by two key players, the expansion of
apical cell area by mitotic domains and the tissue compression by germ band
extension. These events create a convergent flow at the head--trunk boundary.
Without the formation of the cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the
head--trunk boundary inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably.
During normal embryogenesis, the genetically-determined cephalic furrow
predictably anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions and primes the
position of folding at the head--trunk boundary. The cephalic furrow
invagination directs tissue flow storing a significant amount of epithelial
area thus preventing epithelial instability. We thus propose the cephalic
furrow acts as a temporary buffer for the conflicting tissue interactions at
the head--trunk boundary during gastrulation.

<!--Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--We used live-imaging and laser cauterizations in cephalic furrow mutants.-->

<!--Interestingly, in *eve* embryos where the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, a late fold appears in the cephalic region [@Vincent1997-fa]. The origin of this late fold is unclear whether it is a reminiscent of the cephalic furrow patterning or formed by other developmental mechanisms. Thus, the physical role in the global dynamics of *Drosophila* gastrulation remains poorly understood.-->

<!--This process remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Mutants for either *btd* or *eve* fail to initiate the cephalic furrow [@Vincent1997-fa]. -->

<!--a patterning that can be achieved with only four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf]-->

<!--The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead* (*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve* embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination [@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--A tissue fold can put epithelial cells in close contact and initiate cell-to-cell communication important for the patterning of blastoderm cells, but so far there is no evidence.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow is genetically-defined with a precise stereotypic timing and position. The invagination is large extending from dorsal to ventral and deep sinking almost the whole yolk invagination at an important anatomical landmark of the embryo, the head--trunk boundary. Yet, the cephalic furrow, unlike the ventral furrow, does not give rise to a particular cell fates and is transient, this massive structure progressively unfolds before germ band retraction. These features, being a major but transient structure make the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic morphogenetic movements in *Drosophila* gastrulation (@fig:headtrunk).-->

<!--Cephalic furrow directs convergent tissue flow preventing epithelial deformations at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ from the cephalic furrow in timing, formation dynamics, folded area, and morphology. The number and position of ectopic folds across the anteroposterior axis varies between individual mutant embryos. We show the timing and position of ectopic folds correlates with the formation of mitotic domains, suggesting that local tissue interactions are causing the tissue to buckle. These local interactions, however, are not sufficient to generate ectopic folds. Using laser cauterizations to mechanically block the germ band extension, we show the occurrence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary depends on the global tissue compression caused by the germ band extension, and that this interaction also contributes to the cephalic furrow formation in normal embryogenesis.-->

<!--Our analyses reveal the head--trunk boundary is a convergent zone of tissue interactions during gastrulation being orchestrated by two morphogenetic events, the mitotic domains causing the expansion of head tissues, and the germ band causing the compression of trunk tissues. Without the formation of the cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary will inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably. Thus, we propose the cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

# Results

<!--Live-imaging of cephalic furrow mutants to capture tissue dynamics-->

The cephalic furrow is a highly-dynamic structure present for a brief period
during embryogenesis. It forms at the onset of gastrulation and unfolds
completely less than three hours later [@Hartenstein1985-zs]. To understand the
role of this prominent invagination during gastrulation, our study analyzes the
tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary during normal embryogenesis and
how these interactions are affected when the cephalic furrow is absent in
mutant embryos. To capture the cell shape changes and tissue dynamics occurring
of cephalic furrow mutants, we generated flies containing loss-of-function
alleles known to disrupt cephalic furrow formation [*btd^XA^* and *eve^3^*,
@Vincent1997-fa] and a fluorescent membrane marker [GAP43-mCherry,
@Martin2010-pb], and imaged the embryos *in toto* under high-temporal
resolution using lightsheet microscopy for a period of two hours after
gastrulation.

<!--Mutants show late ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary-->

In both wild type and embryos heterozygote for the *btd* or *eve* alleles (i.e.
sibling controls), the cephalic furrow initiates when the cellularization is
complete invaginating for the first 15 minutes, and beginning to unfold its
distal end at 30 minutes after gastrulation ({@fig:ectopic}A). In embryos
homozygote for the *btd* or *eve* alleles (i.e. mutants), the cephalic furrow
fails to invaginate and no indentation is visible in the lateral surface in
Stages 6 and 7a ({@fig:ectopic}A). In the subsequent Stages 7b and 8, however,
we observe the formation of epithelial folds in the head--trunk region of *btd*
and *eve* mutant embryos ({@fig:ectopic}A, Video 1 and 2). These folds appear
soon after the appearance of the mitotic domains on the head region in Stage 7b
and becoming notable in Stage 8. Unlike the cephalic furrow, however, these
late folds have an even shorter existence, folding and unfolding in a span of
20 min ({@fig:ectopic}A).

<!--TODO: How long does the cephalic and ectopic lasts (get numbers)-->
<!--TODO: Insert mid-paragraph above note about initiator cells in btd?-->

@Vincent1997-fa described the formation of a late fold in *eve* mutants but not
in *btd* mutants, even though it has been depicted in *btd* embryos in later
works [see Figure 8F in @Blankenship2001-tm; and Figure S5B in
@Eritano2020-mi]. These folds do not seem to form via the cephalic furrow
program, but their developmental origin and the processes underlying their
formation has remained unanswered. The fact that both *btd* and *eve* embryos
invariably form late folds raised the question whether this folding is
associated with the absence of the cephalic furrow in these embryos. We thus
characterize the formation of ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants to
understand the processes driving these folding events at the head--trunk
interface.

<!--Ectopic fold shape, dynamics and size-->
<!--TODO: Include tortuosity of dorsal views around here-->

The late ectopic folds lack the stereotypic cell morphologies, such as
wedge-shaped apex cells, have a wider, often asymmetric cleft
({@fig:dynamics}A, Video 3 and 4). The progression of ectopic buckling differs
from the progressive invagination in sibling controls with the epithelia being
unchanged for a period and then buckling late in development. We identified a
difference between *btd* and *eve* embryos. While *eve* mutants show no
initiator cell behavior, we observe cell shape changes in *btd* mutants that are
reminiscent of initiator cell behaviors ({@fig:dynamics}B). Despite the
unorganized shape of the ectopic folds, they buckle reasonably deep into the
yolk but are shallower, reaching in average 75% of the length of the cephalic
furrow in sibling controls ({@fig:dynamics}C).

<!--Ectopic folding is variable between individuals-->

To characterize the distribution and dynamics of ectopic fold formation, we
manually traced individual folds and extracted tortuosity measurements, angle
displacement, folded area, and location along the anteroposterior axis. Mutant
embryos form between one and four ectopic folds in each lateral side (Table 1),
typically showing two ectopic folds along the head--trunk interface
({@fig:dynamics}D, Video 5). We observe the position of ectopic folds varies
between individual mutant embryos ({@fig:dynamics}G), and can even differ
between the left and right side of the same embryo ({@fig:dynamics}H).

The cephalic furrow forms as a straight line almost orthogonal (~80°) to the
anteroposterior axis ({@fig:dynamics}E,F). During the first 15 min after
gastrulation, it progressively tilts by the combined movements of the dorsal
portion shifting to the posterior, while its ventral portion shifting to the
anterior reaching around from ~60° of inclination ({@fig:dynamics}F,G). At the
same time the cephalic furrow invaginates and extends to the dorsal and ventral
sides, the fold outline becomes smoothly bended in a stereotypic manner as
evidence by the measurement of tortuosity of the manual traces
({@fig:dynamics}F,H). The tortuosity values become more variable with the
occurrence of mitotic domains around 13 min, which deform the fold outline
({@fig:dynamics}F,H). In contrast, ectopic folds form already tilted with
angles around 70--60°, extend less dorsal or ventral, and unfold earlier
compared to the cephalic furrow ({@fig:dynamics}E,F). Neither the angle of
formation nor the tortuosity values of ectopic fold traces show any particular
trend in time ({@fig:dynamics}E,F).

Finally we estimated the total area of folded epithelial tissue contained in
ectopic folds compared to the cephalic furrow ({@fig:dynamics}H,I). The total
area of folded tissue per embryo in *btd* and *eve* mutants (i.e. the sum of
individual ectopic folds) is less than half of the area contained within the
cephalic furrow invagination in sibling controls ({@fig:dynamics}I). But
interestingly, despite their variable smaller area, we found no cephalic furrow
mutants without ectopic folds being formed at their head--trunk boundary.

<!--We observe that individual mutant embryos can have the same total invaginated area either having one deep fold or two shallower folds.-->

These data reveal significant differences ectopic fold and cephalic furrow
formation. We observe that ectopic folds differ from the cephalic furrow in
their timing of formation, in their number, in their morphology, in their shape
dynamics, and in their depth and folded area, suggesting the two are formed by
distinct developmental mechanisms. Moreover, the formation of ectopic folds is
more variable than that of the cephalic furrow, which contrasts with the
stereotypic movements of the cephalic furrow formation described here and
elsewhere [@Liu2013-lc], and indicates that ectopic fold formation might be
driven by stochastic mechanical forces in the epithelia rather than by genetic
patterning.

We first analyzed the possibility that mitotic domains---groups of blastoderm
cells that divide in synchrony during mitotic cycle 14 [@Foe1989-cw]---are
involved in the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants. We
observe a correlation between the position of ectopic folds at the head--trunk
interface in cephalic furrow mutants, with the position of mitotic domains.
That is, ectopic folds often form adjacent to or in between mitotic domains
({@fig:mitotic}B,C).

*btd* embryos show ectopic folds in four distinct locations, either anterior or
posterior to the canonical cephalic furrow position. They can form between MD1
and MD9/MD5, between MD5 and MD7, between MD7 and MD6, and posterior to MD6
({@fig:mitotic}B). *eve* embryos show a similar pattern of folding events
except for lacking ectopic folds between MD7 and MD6. The difference can be
related to the fact that *btd* embryos lack MD2 [@Edgar1994-pi] while *eve*
mutants have an expanded MD2 [@Vincent1997-fa].

The timing of tissue buckling coincides with the expansion of apical cell area
in mitotic domains. The expansion occurs when a group of epithelial cells round
up during anaphase which increases their apical area. The expansion precedes
ectopic folding and the position of buckling occurs in the adjacent
non-dividing epithelial cells ({@fig:mitotic}B). The tissue folds inwards
forming an ectopic fold which partially contains the area of adjacent mitotic
domains ({@fig:mitotic}B). The buckling occurs abruptly with the compression of
non-dividing cells caused by the cell rounding in mitotic domains
({@fig:mitotic}B), in contrast to the progressive invagination characteristic
of the normal cephalic furrow (Video 6). These observations suggest the
formation of mitotic domains influence the formation of ectopic folds in *btd*
and *eve* mutants.

Previous observations suggest that force imbalance between mitotic domains
[@Ko2020-wk] and forces generated by mitotic expansion [@Gupta2021-oo] can
influence adjacent tissue and play a role in tissue buckling. Mitotic rounding
can induce invagination [@Kondo2013-gy]. We generated a 1D line model to
understand whether the strain caused by the mitotic expansion in the monolayer
epithelia could determine the position of folding events in the epithelia.
Using a X model and running Y simulations, we observe that mitotic expansion
can increase the probability of folding only when that expansion is greater
than 1.25x, and that the fold depth correlates with the expansion dimension
({@fig:model}). We also observe that the folds occur at the edge of the mitotic
domains, reminiscent of what occurs *in vivo* ({@fig:mitotic}B), and that when
two mitotic domains are near each other, the probability of folding occurring
between them increases ({@fig:model}).

We then included in the simulation the cephalic furrow using a negative
intrinsic curvature parameter to understand how it impacts and scales with the
effects of the mitotic expansion. We observe the presence of the cephalic
furrow greatly decreases the probability of ectopic folds forming in the
surrounding regions, and the depth of folds generated by mitotic expansion.
This is specially true when we introduce a delay in the mitotic expansion as it
occurs in the embryo (mitotic domains only appear when the cephalic furrow is
half-invaginated), but the effects of a folding on adjacent fold probability
also occurs in folds generated by mitotic domains. These simulations provide a
basic model of how mitotic expansions and their interactions can lead to
ectopic fold formation in a epithelial monolayer and explain the distribution
pattern of folding events observed *in vivo*.

Our model, however, does not exclude that other mechanical forces acting at the
head--trunk interface necessary for the formation of ectopic folds. The
analysis of tissue flows during gastrulation show that, when ectopic folds are
being formed, the dorsal portion of the head--trunk boundary is a convergent
zone where tissues from the head and from the trunk collide ({@fig:mitotic}D).
In the absence of the cephalic furrow, the epithelial cells in this region
between the most posterior mitotic domains (MD6) and the tip of the germ band,
undergo significant compression ({@fig:mitotic}E). These observations suggest
the mechanical forces exerted by the germ band extension might play a role in
ectopic fold formation.

We thus tested this hypothesis by mechanically blocking the extension of the
germ band in *btd* and *eve* mutants by cauterizing the blastoderm tissue to
the vitelline envelope at the onset of gastrulation ({@fig:cauterization}A). In
contrast to the non-cauterized (control) *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos, when
the germ band extension is blocked in cauterized mutant embryos, they show no
ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary ({@fig:cauterization}B, Video 7,8);
despite the presence of mitotic domains compressing non-dividing cells
({@fig:cauterization}B,C). We systematically quantified how much the monolayer
epithelium at the head--trunk boundary is deformed between non-cauterized and
cauterized *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos. Our analysis show the epithelium of
non-cauterized mutants undergoes a greater range of deformations and buckling
events compared to the cauterized mutants whose germ band extension was
mechanically blocked ({@fig:cauterization}D--F). These experiments reveal the
local forces generated by the mitotic domains alone are insufficient to cause
the tissue to buckle, and that the concomitant global mechanical forces
generated by the extension of the germ band are necessary to cause the
formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants.

To test whether the germ band extension alone is sufficient to cause
deformations and ectopic buckling in the head region without the presence of
mitotic domains, we incorporated the findings above and the germ band extension
into our 1D in silico model. The simulations show the germ band extension only
generates ectopic folding when its extension rate is above X. This indicates
the in vivo the germ band extension alone without the presence of the cephalic
furrow would not generate ectopic folds (@fig:model).

<!--The open questions about head--trunk boundary evolution-->

- The open questions about cephalic furrow evolution
- Contribution to diversity of head--trunk boundary in bilaterians


<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

<!--When mitotic domains are present, the dividing cells generate areas prone to buckling, which bias the formation of ectopic folds. However, the germ band extension is what drives the formation of ectopic folds.-->

<!--Local tissue strain and global stiffness modulate ectopic folding-->

<!--The mechanical interactions during gastrulation seem to make the folding at the head--trunk interface inevitable. This might partly explain why so few cephalic furrow mutants have been identified. Because even though the cephalic furrow is disrupted, it will still fold, though more irregular.-->

<!--TODO: Physical in silico role of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--The physical role of the cephalic furrow has been investigated in silico. Numerical approaches suggest the cephalic furrow might play a global role to the complex morphogenetic movements of gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb; @Dicko2017-wz]. One hypothesis is that the cephalic furrow act as a barrier to the tissue flows and orients the germ band extension towards the posterior [@Dicko2017-wz]. However, the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not been investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac].-->

<!--Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be able to investigate the cephalic furrow formation.-->

<!--Late forces lead to epithelial instability-->

The formation of ectopic folds in eve mutants is described in the foundational
work by Vincent. The underlying mechanisms involved were unknown. Our analyses
corroborate and expand these initial observations to btd. We find the formation
of ectopic folds is a direct consequence of the absence of the cephalic furrow
as observed in mutant embryos. We describe the presence of ectopic folds and
deformations in the head--trunk epithelia in the absence of the cephalic
furrow. 

Our analyses suggest that mechanical rather than genetic forces underlie the
instability in the monolayer epithelia which leads to tissue buckling.
Mechanical folds occur in... [@refs] and are influenced by this and that.

<!--Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains-->

Contribution of local forces by mitotic domains. The influence of mitotic
forces in adjacent cells is being investigated [@ref]. They have been shown to
exert forces during expansion [@ref], and associated with the formation of
ectopic folds by creating an imbalance of forces in contractile tissues [@ref].
Timing and position coincides and we observe strain and force imbalance. We
find the expansion of mitotic domains indeed influences the stability of
adjacent tissues and bias the position of folding events. The in silico model
reveals the mitotic strain leads to buckling. Thus mitotic forces matter.

<!--Germ band elongation is required for ectopic folds-->

Unexpectedly, we determined this influence to be from the germ band extension
at the head--trunk boundary. Gastrulation has complex movements usually studied
individually. More and more the interactions between gastrulation movements and
between embryo and shell are being investigated for this and that [@ref]. These
works have shown how tissue interactions shape morphogenesis but usually on a
shorter range. Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation
where the extension of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk
interface. This shows evidence of the long range global impact the germ band
extension exerts during gastrulation.

<!--TODO: Discussion tissue fluidity here?-->

<!--Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position-->

<!--The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone-->

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is a convergent zone of
tissue flow during gastrulation. In early stages the relatively static head
tissues contrast with the ventral-moving trunk tissues. In wild type this
ventral flow is directed and enhanced by the active pull from the cephalic
furrow, while in mutants the flow more variable and restricted more
posteriorly. A similar flow has been predicted numerically where the formation
of the cephalic furrow would direct the tissue flows of the entire embryo
[@ref]. In the absence of the cephalic furrow, the tissue flows at the
head--trunk boundary are disrupted, and the expansion caused by mitotic domains
combined with the compression caused by the germ band extension increases
tissue strain at the head--trunk boundary and extra tissue not invaginated,
which the outcome is the formation of stochastic ectopic folds of mechanical
origin. Our data reveals what happens without the cephalic furrow and allow us
to speculate on the putative developmental role of the cephalic furrow for
gastrulation.

Thus, what the cephalic furrow accomplishes during gastrulation is to
anticipate the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary by priming the
position of a predictable (and genetically-determined fold). The convergent
tissue interactions are directed and buffered by the cephalic furrow
invagination. The cephalic furrow thus prevents the epithelial instability in
an area of potential tissue interactions, and with that potential defects
associated with erratic buckling, such as the compromise of cell-to-cell
interactions or short-range signaling in the epithelia, and thus ensure a
stereotypical balance of forces required for the precise patterning of
embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

<!--Broader evolutionary overview-->

Our study analyzes the developmental role of the cephalic furrow in
*Drosophila*. We propose it accomplishes a mechanical role during gastrulation
buffering tissue interactions between head and trunk. It remains unclear,
however, what led to the evolution of cephalic furrow in the first place and
the traits associated with it. Further comparative work in insect development
is needed to clarify the evolutionary context for the evolution of the cephalic
furrow and reveal a glimpse of the complex mechanical underpinnings of
gastrulation dynamics around the head--trunk boundary of bilaterians.

<!--Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary, to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus preventing erratic epithelial buckling.-->

<!--## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes-->

<!--The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.-->

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process. That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process caused by the germ band was not.-->

<!--Overall, our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.-->

<!--## Conclusions-->

<!--Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila. The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.-->

# Methods

## Fly stocks and genetics

We used the mutant alleles btd^XA^ (FlyBase: FBal0030657, BDSC: #26815) and
eve^3^ (FlyBase: FBal0003885, BDSC #299), the balancers FM7c-KrGFP (BDSC:
#5193) and CyO-twiGFP (gift from Akanksha Jain), and the membrane fluorescent
marker GAP43-mCherry (@Martin2010-pb, gift from Kassiani Skouloudaki), to
establish the imaging stocks. We imaged the final genotypes
btd^XA^/FM7c-KrGFP;; GAP43-mCherry/MKRS and eve^3^/CyO-twiGFP;
GAP43-mCherry/MKRS. We identified homozygous embryos by the absence of GFP
signal.

![Late ectopic folds folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants. (A) Lateral views of a
btd heterozygote (control), a btd homozygote, and an eve homozygote showing the
late formation of ectopic folds around 35--45% germ band extension after the
appearance of mitotic domains. (B) Profile views of control, btd and eve
embryos showing the morphology of the ectopic folds compared to the cephalic
furrow. (C) Illustration showing the timing of developmental events in wild
type compared to cephalic furrow mutants. (D) Length of cephalic furrow
compared to ectopic folds in btd and eve embryos. Arrows indicate the cephalic
furrow. Arrowheads indicate ectopic folds. Asterisks indicate the position of
mitotic domains. Developmental staging based on
