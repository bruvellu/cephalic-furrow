# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep epithelial fold that forms at the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. Its formation is under strict
genetic control but, unlike other embryonic invaginations, the cephalic furrow
does not give rise to any precursor tissues or larval structures. It unfolds
and vanishes without a trace. Here we investigate if the cephalic furrow plays
a mechanical role in gastrulation. We imaged mutant embryos live to understand
how the lack of the cephalic furrow impacts the tissue dynamics at the
head--trunk interface. We find that without the cephalic furrow, the monolayer
epithelium will buckle erratically, forming ectopic folds during gastrulation.
We show that ectopic folds are caused by extrinsic tissue forces which are
driven by the concomitant expansion of mitotic domains in the head, and by the
extension of the germ band in the trunk. Our experimental and modeling data
suggests that these opposed tissue flows inevitably increase the mechanical
stress at the head--trunk boundary, a condition exacerbated in cephalic furrow
mutants due to the excess of tissue on the blastoderm surface. In normal
development, these physical interactions are counteracted by the cephalic
furrow, which primes the position of folding, and creates a predictable
temporary storage of epithelial tissue before the mitotic expansions and germ
band extension. We thus propose the cephalic furrow plays a mechanical role in
*Drosophila* gastrulation acting as a buffer and preventing epithelial
instability at the head--trunk boundary.

# Background

The head--trunk boundary in the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* is
demarcated by a deep epithelial fold known as the cephalic furrow. It is one of
the first morphogenetic movements in the embryo, beginning at the onset of
gastrulation as bilateral indentations in the anterior blastoderm
[@Hartenstein1985-zs]. The indentations correspond to a single row of initiator
cells which sink below the basal lamina with the surrounding tissues and
quickly invaginate deep into the yolk sac [@Spencer2015-td]. The resulting
structure is a prominent invagination and anatomical landmark that divides the
posterior portion of the head (procephalon) from the segmented trunk (germ
band) [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw].

The position of the cephalic furrow is specified with remarkable accuracy
[@Liu2013-lc]. It requires the zygotic expression of *buttonhead* (*btd*) and
*even skipped* (*eve*), where the overlap between the two determines the row of
initiator cells [@Vincent1997-fa]. The activation of lateral myosin
contractility cause the shortening of initiator cells which initiates the
invagination, while the mechanical coupling between the epithelial cells lining
the furrow ensures the precision of the tissue fold during morphogenesis
[@Eritano2020-mi]. Although the mechanisms controlling the formation of the
cephalic furrow remain poorly understood [@Gilmour2017-um], the process is
under precise genetic control and safeguarding mechanisms are in place that
ensure the accuracy of morphogenesis.

Despite such tight genetic control, the function of the cephalic furrow remains
a mystery. Unlike other embryonic invaginations, such as the ventral furrow or
midgut invaginations, which are associated with mesoderm and endoderm
formation, the cephalic furrow does not give rise to any precursor tissues or
larval structures. Even more intriguingly, the cephalic furrow is ephemeral. It
progressively unfolds a couple of hours after gastrulation without leaving
morphological traces [@Vincent1997-fa].

<!--TODO: Move to introduction. The cephalic furrow is the least understood morphogenetic movement in *Drosophila* gastrulation [@Gilmour2017-um].-->

<!--Numerical approaches suggest the cephalic furrow orients global tissue flows in *Drosophila* gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb; @Dicko2017-wz]. It can act as a barrier for the entire embryo, orienting the germ band extension towards the posterior [@Dicko2017-wz].-->

A variety of roles have been proposed for the cephalic furrow. That it might
determine regulatory domains in the embryo dividing the head and trunk. But
because no special tissues have been identified, raise the possibility that the
cephalic furrow might play a physical role. That it might serve as temporary
tissue storage during gastrulation [@Turner1977-ol]. Or that it might act as a
barrier to the tissue flows generated by the germ band extension during
gastrulation [@Dicko2017-wz]. But these hypotheses or the interactions of the
cephalic furrow with other morphogenetic movements have not been investigated
*in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac].

<!--TODO: Fix sentence and reference about CF roles.-->

<!--TODO: Move original description of ectopic folds to intro. Because both mutants exhibit such intriguing ectopic folds, we wondered if their formation could be causally linked to the absence of the cephalic furrow. A late head fold was previously described in *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa], but the processes that drive the formation of these ectopic folds has not been studied.

In this study we investigate whether the cephalic furrow has a mechanical role
during gastrulation by examining how the tissue interactions at the head--trunk
boundary are impacted by defects in cephalic furrow formation. We find that
cephalic furrow mutants show increased strain and ectopic buckling events in
the monolayer epithelium at the head--trunk interface. We show this epithelial
instability is the result of extrinsic forces and is caused by the simultaneous
expansion of mitotic domains in the head, and the extension of the germ band in
the trunk. Our data suggests that the role of the cephalic furrow in normal
development is to buffer these opposing tissue flows by priming the position of
folding, and thus preventing mechanical stress at the head--trunk boundary.

First is that we are interested in understanding what’s the function of the
cephalic furrow. One way to test this is to remove the cephalic furrow, or
prevent it from invaginating, and analyze the consequences to the embryonic
tissues. That’s what we did. We first tried to determine if there is any
general, observable consequence. Because the cephalic furrow is highly-dynamic
and has a short life-span, we decided to go for live-imaging to be able to
capture the small and large scale dynamics.

We asked whether the lack of a cephalic furrow has any observable effect in the
tissue properties 

We asked whether the lack of the cephalic furrow has any direct
consequences to the dynamics of embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

To understand the role of the cephalic furrow, we asked whether embryos which
lack the cephalic furrow show any consequences.

To understand how the absence of the cephalic furrow impacts the dynamics of
embryonic tissues, we imaged cephalic furrow mutants under high-temporal
resolution. We generated fluorescent flies containing the loss-of-function
alleles *btd^XA^* and *eve^3^* [@Vincent1997-fa]. *btd* and eve mutants

To analyze how the embryonic tissues behave without the cephalic furrow we

To analyze how defects in cephalic furrow formation impact the gastrulation
processes, , and imaged
the mutant embryos *in toto* under high-temporal resolution using lightsheet
microscopy.

The cephalic furrow first appears at the onset of cellularization (stage 6). It
invaginates for 15 min and begins to unfold about 30 min after the start of
gastrulation ({@fig:ectopic}A). In *btd* and *eve* mutants, gastrulation begins
normally but no invagination appears at the head--trunk boundary epithelia on
stages 6 and 7 ({@fig:ectopic}A). Cells near the canonical cephalic furrow site
of *btd* mutants undergo a subtle apical constriction ({@fig:initiator}A and
{!@fig:vid-initiator}). This creates an indentation delayed in relation to the
cephalic furrow, but similar in shape except that no cell shortening occurs
({@fig:initiator}B). No apical constriction or indentation is present in *eve*
mutants ({@fig:initiator}A,B). At stage 7b, when the germ band extension
reaches about 35% of the embryo length, we observe the formation of a series of
epithelial folds in both *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos ({@fig:ectopic}A,
{!@fig:vid-lateral-btd} and {!@fig:vid-lateral-eve}). They form on the
head--trunk epithelia and quickly disappear from surface within a period of
about 20 min ({@fig:ectopic}B). Because both mutants exhibit such intriguing
ectopic folds, we wondered if their formation could be causally linked to the
absence of the cephalic furrow. A late head fold was previously described in
*eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa], but the processes that drive the formation of
these ectopic folds has not been studied. Therefore, to understand the origin
of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants, we analyzed their morphology and
dynamics throughout development.

Mutant embryos invariably form one to four ectopic folds on each side of the
body (*btd*=2.3±0.9 n=12, *eve*=1.8±0.7 n=9, see Table S1). These lack the
stereotypic cell morphologies of the cephalic furrow, such as wedge-shaped
initiator cells, and have a wider and often asymmetric cleft ({@fig:dynamics}A,
{!@fig:vid-profile-btd} and {!@fig:vid-profile-eve}). Unlike the predictable
positioning of the cephalic furrow in normal development, the position of
ectopic folds varies between individual mutant embryos. They can form either
anterior or posterior of the head--trunk boundary ({@fig:dynamics}B,
{!@fig:vid-dynamics-btd} and {!@fig:vid-variability-btd}). Ectopic fold
formation also shows different dynamics compared to the cephalic furrow
formation ({@fig:dynamics}C). While the cephalic furrow progressively declines
posteriorly along the first 15 min after gastrulation, the ectopic folds form
already tilted and have no obvious trend in time ({@fig:dynamics}D--F). Ectopic
folds are about 25% shorter than the cephalic furrow of sibling controls
({@fig:dynamics}H). Accordingly, the total epithelial area contained within
ectopic folds is about half of the area contained within the cephalic furrow
invagination ({@fig:dynamics}G,I). These analyses reveal that the formation of
ectopic folds differs from, and is more variable than, that of the cephalic
furrow. This suggests that different mechanisms are involved, and that
extrinsic tissue forces, rather than intrinsic morphogenetic mechanisms, might
be driving the formation of ectopic folds.

The formation of ectopic folds coincides with the appearance of mitotic
domains---groups of blastoderm cells that divide in synchrony during mitotic
cycle 14 [@Foe1989-cw] ({@fig:ectopic}A,B). Ectopic folds often form adjacent
to or in between mitotic domains ({@fig:mitotic}A). There are four distinct
locations, between MD1 and MD5/MD9, between MD5 and MD7, between MD7 and MD6,
and posterior to MD6 ({@fig:mitotic}A). When the dividing cells round up for
mitosis, they are displaced apically in the monolayer epithelium increasing
their apical area. The simultaneous cell rounding in mitotic domains causes a
local tissue expansion that compresses adjacent non-dividing cells
({@fig:mitotic}B). This expansion always precedes the formation of ectopic
folds. The region of non-dividing cells under compression is the first to
buckle towards the yolk, followed by a portion of the mitotic domains
({@fig:mitotic}B). The buckling occurs abruptly ({@fig:initiator}B and
{!@fig:vid-mitotic-fold}). Unlike the early, progressive invagination of the
cephalic furrow, the formation of ectopic folds coincides with the maximum
expansion of mitotic mitotic domains, and with the peak of strain in the tissue
({@fig:mitotic}C and {!@fig:vid-mitotic-strain}). These observations suggest
that mitotic expansions can induce or facilitate buckling events in the
head--trunk interface of *btd* and *eve* mutants.

To test if the mitotic expansions are required for the formation of ectopic
folds, we generated double-mutant flies combining *btd* with a loss-of-function
allele of *string* (*stg*), a phosphatase that regulates the cell divisions in
cycle 14 [@Edgar1989-hv]. Embryos mutant for *stg* have no mitotic domains in
cycle 14 but the embryo still gastrulates normally [@Edgar1989-hv]
({@fig:double-mutants}A; {@fig:vid-stg-lateral}). The cephalic furrow
invaginates as usual, and the fold is even organized compared to embryos with
mitotic domains ({@fig:double-mutants}B and {@fig:vid-stg-dorsal}). We observe
that *btd*--*stg* double-mutants lack both the cephalic furrow and the mitotic
domains ({@fig:double-mutants}C,D). None form ectopic folds at the head--trunk
interface ({@fig:double-mutants}C,D, {@fig:vid-double-lateral} and
{@fig:vid-double-dorsal}). This indicates that the presence of mitotic domains
is needed for the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--TODO: For stg, include dorsal depth estimation?-->

<!--TODO: For stg, include measure of invaginated area?-->

<!--TODO: Put some mitotic domain modeling here?-->

Concomitant to the formation of mitotic domains in the head, the germ band
extension is reaching a third of the embryo length ({@fig:ectopic}A). We noted
that in cephalic furrow mutants, the dorsal epithelial cells between the
mitotic domains and the germ band are more compressed compared to sibling
controls ({@fig:cauterization}A). To test if the mechanical stress caused by
the germ band contributes to the formation of ectopic folds, we prevented the
extension of the germ band in *btd* and *eve* mutants *in vivo*. We cauterized
a small posterodorsal area at the onset of gastrulation that attached the
epithelial tissue to the vitelline envelope creating a mechanical block for the
germ band extension ({@fig:cauterization}B). When the germ band extension is
blocked in *btd* or *eve* mutants, no ectopic folds form on the head--trunk
interface ({@fig:cauterization}C, {!@fig:vid-cautlat-eve},
{!@fig:vid-cautdor-eve} and {!@fig:vid-cautdor-btd}). The mitotic domains are
still present and compress non-dividing cells, but the mitotic expansion does
not lead to buckling events ({@fig:cauterization}C,D). Cauterized mutant
embryos show less deformations on the epithelium outline compared to
non-cauterized mutant embryos ({@fig:cauterization}E--G). These experiments
reveal that local mitotic expansions are insufficient to cause the tissue to
buckle. Instead, the global compression of trunk tissues caused by the
elongating germ band is the major driving force for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--TODO: Insert prd phenotype here?-->

This unexpected long-range interaction between the head and trunk regions led
us to ask whether the compression exerted by the germ band extension might push
the invagination of the cephalic furrow in normal development. Because the
initial phase of the cephalic furrow invagination is clearly autonomous
[@Vincent1997-fa; @Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi], we first determined the
extension of the region being pulled in at the onset of gastrulation. We
measured the recoil velocity of laser-ablated cell membranes anterior and
posterior to the initiator cells, as a proxy for the current tension in the
tissue ({@fig:wildtype}F). The recoil velocity increases with time and
decreases with the distance from the initiator cells ({@fig:wildtype}G,H). The
tension profiles is symmetric anterior and posterior to the cephalic furrow,
and becomes negligible around 40 µm from the initiator cells
({@fig:wildtype}H). This indicates that a region 80 µm wide is under the active
pull of the cephalic furrow during early gastrulation. 

<!--an idea already suggested by classical morphological works of *Drosophila* embryogenesis [@Campos-Ortega1997-rd].-->

We then tested if the germ band extension is pushing the cephalic furrow deeper
in later stages. We blocked the germ band extension by cauterization in wild
type embryos and measured the maximum depth of the cephalic furrow. The maximum
depth of the cephalic furrow in cauterized embryos is about 10% shallower than
non-cauterized embryos ({@fig:wildtype}A--D). These experiments suggest that in
normal development the active pull generated by the cephalic furrow is the main
driver of the invagination. The germ band extension accounts only for a mild
influence in the depth of the invagination.

<!--TODO: AK will write one/two paragraphs here.-->

To complement our *in vivo* observations, we built a model of the physical
interactions occurring between mitotic domains, ectopic folds, the germ band
and the cephalic furrow. Our model consists of series of particles connected by
springs with $\kappa/\lambda$ rigidity to represent the monolayer epithelium of
the blastoderm ({@fig:model}A). The particles are arranged on an elliptical arc
the approximates the curvature of the lateral side of the embryo in a
dorsal/frontal section. The particles are contained on one side by an
incompressible layer representing the vitelline envelope. The extension of the
germ band occurs by the displacement of the posterior end of the epithelium
towards the anterior end. Mitotic domains are represented by regions of
compressed particles to maintain constant rigidity. The cephalic furrow is
simulated by a region of intrinsic negative curvature. We determined the
rigidity value by a parameter sweep using as a reference the cauterization in
mutants (i.e. MD without GB = no ectopic folds), and the double mutant
observation (i.e. GB without MD = [no] ectopic folds).

<!--In our initial simulations we saw that ectopic folds were forming within a mitotic domain, something we have not observed *in vivo*. This suggests the physical properties of dividing cells must be change the properties of the -->

We analyzed how the mitotic expansions influence the probability and
distribution of buckling events. This probability is increased when the mitotic
expansion is greater than 1.25 times in width ({@fig:model}B). Folds occur
mostly at the edges of mitotic domains which also partially buckle inwards, a
pattern we observe *in vivo* ({@fig:mitotic}B and {@fig:model}B). The
probability of folding between mitotic domains increases significantly below a
critical distance of separation. But when too close to each other, the folding
is inhibited ({@fig:model}B). We also found that a folding event decreases the
probability of other folds to form in the neighborhood. This inhibitory effect
is evident in simulations that include the cephalic furrow ({@fig:model}C).
With our model we are able to calculate the amount of extra tissue required to
obtain ectopic folds. We also quantified the impact of germ band compression
for the cephalic furrow depth. These correlate well with our *in vivo*
observations and experiments. Our model reveals how the highly-dynamic tissue
events at the head--trunk boundary can be explained by an interplay of physical
interactions.

Taken together, our analyses reveal that the formation of ectopic folds in
cephalic furrow mutants is a direct consequence of the tissue that remains on
the blastoderm surface. This excess of tissue increases the mechanical stress
at the head--trunk boundary with the concomitant expansion of mitotic domains
in the head collide with the compression of trunk tissues by the extension of
the germ band. The cephalic furrow actively invaginates before mitotic domains
and germ band extension. By anticipating and storing tissues away the cephalic
furrow buffers these opposed interactions playing a mechanical role during
gastrulation.

<!--TODO: Write-up a closing paragraph for the results-->

<!--Thus, we propose the cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--Some predictions that can be taken from the models: what is the minimum/maximum area that needs to be invaginated so that the germ band does not causes ectopic folds. It suggests how much of the mitotic expansion and extension are needed to create instability in an epithelial monolayer. Finally, it suggests that the germ abnd is also pushing the epithelium in vivo.-->

# Discussion

<!--Our work suggests the cephalic furrow has a mechanical role during gastrulation.-->

<!--Our in vivo data shows that the significant area of epithelia remaining on the surface increases the mechanical stress at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--These insights allow us to speculate about putative physical role for the cephalic furrow during gastrulation.-->

Epithelial folding often involves a combination of intrinsic cellular and
extrinsic tissue forces [@Denk-Lobnig2020-pr]. Cell-autonomous shape changes
can fold a tissue. External stresses such as compressive forces can generate
mechanical instability in the tissue and lead to the formation of epithelial
folds [@Nelson2016-gz; @Collinet2021-qa].

The cephalic furrow invaginates through the action of initiator cells. When
this intrinsic force fails, we also observe the formation of one or more
ectopic folds in the epithelium. The formation of a late fold near the cephalic
furrow position was previously described in *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa] and
only recently been noted in *btd* mutants [see Figure S5B in @Eritano2020-mi],
even though they are present in previous images of *btd* embryos [see Figure 8F
in @Blankenship2001-tm]. But the developmental processes driving formation of
ectopic folds have remained obscure.

Our live-imaging data provides evidence that ectopic folds form as a direct
consequence of cephalic furrow absence. The extra tissue on the surface
generates additional extrinsic mechanical stress on the monolayer epithelium
during gastrulation at the head--trunk boundary. We show there are at least two
key extrinsic forces involved in the formation of these ectopic folds, the
mitotic domain expansions and the germ band extension.

Cell division events are known to alter the local properties of epithelial
monolayers when dividing cells generate outward forces and local stresses
[@Gupta2021-oo]. Mitotic cell rounding have been shown to induce epithelial
invagination in the tracheal placode of *Drosophila* [@Kondo2013-gy], as well
as in murine intestine villi [@Freddo2016-et]. Interestingly, in both cases an
intraepithelial compressive force is required for the generation of an
invagination during mitotic rounding.

Our in vivo data and in silico simulations suggest that a similar situation
occurs at the head--trunk boundary epithelium. Without an external compressive
force acting on the epithelial cells such as the germ band, as evidenced by
cauterized cephalic furrow mutants, the expansion of mitotic domains are unable
to cause buckling. Thus, although the expansion of mitotic domains generate
areas prone to buckling, it is ultimately the compression from the extending
germ band that drives the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow
mutants, revealing an unexpected long-range tissue interaction between the germ
band and the head--trunk boundary.

<!--TODO: Formation of ectopic folds depend on germ band extension driven by the posterior midgut invagination and not by cell intercalation because eve mutants have no cell intercalation and still form ectopic folds [@Collinet2015].-->

The simultaneous expansion of mitotic domains in the head and the extension of
the germ band from the trunk generate a convergent zone of tissue interactions
that make the folding at the head--trunk interface inevitable without the
presence of the cephalic furrow. The cephalic furrow in *Drosophila* thus acts
as a buffer to the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.

The cephalic furrow controlled by strict genetic regulation primes the position
of folding, generating a single predictable fold that directs the convergent
tissue flows from the head and from the trunk. By anticipating the potential
mechanical stress in the monolayer epithelium, the cephalic furrow thus
prevents tissue instability, and the potential downsides associated with
erratic buckling, such as disruptions in cell-to-cell interactions or
short-range signaling.

The evolution of the cephalic furrow, thus, might have provided a stress-free
solution for tissue flows during gastrulation. Further comparative work in
insect development has the potential to clarify the evolutionary context for
the evolution of the cephalic furrow and reveal a glimpse of the complex
mechanical underpinnings of gastrulation dynamics around the head--trunk
boundary of bilaterians.

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow has a physical role that counteracts the tissue-wide stresses generated by the mitotic domains and germ band extension during gastrulation.-->

<!--It remains unclear, however, what led to the evolution of cephalic furrow in the first place and the traits associated with it.-->

<!--The putative role of the cephalic furrow as buffer raises the hypothesis that it evolved to solve a mechanical problem in the embryo, the fact that head and trunk tissues inevitably collide due to the evolution of the germ band extension. Therefore, our data reveals a case suggesting that mechanical forces in the embryo might be drivers for morphological evolution and might explain some of the diversity of shapes and forms in early embryos inside shells which are not subject to external natural selection. -->

<!--Previous observations suggest that force imbalance between mitotic domains play a role in tissue buckling [@Ko2020-wk].-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

<!--Recent works show how interactions of the embryonic tissues with the shell [@Munster;@Bailles] and between gastrulation movements [@Guo2021] are important to development.-->

<!--However, the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not been investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac].-->

<!--Our work reveals the cephalic furrow formation is mostly driven by intrinsic forces, but that extrinsic forces also play a minor role suggesting a potential interaction between the germ band and cephalic furrow. -->

<!--We show that it buffers the mechanical stress generated by the germ band extension at the head--trunk boundary, and thus prevents instability of the monolayer epithelium within the complex tissue morphogenesis of *Drosophila*.-->

<!--Global interactions between morphogenetic movements-->

<!--Bottomline is that given MD and GB, the tissue is fated to fold-->

<!--CF ensures it will fold nicely and reproducibly-->

<!--The mechanical interactions during gastrulation seem to make the folding at the head--trunk interface inevitable. This might partly explain why so few cephalic furrow mutants have been identified. Because even though the cephalic furrow is disrupted, it will still fold, though more irregular. Our data on prd and gt embryos supports that because the phenotype which is described as a late fold in fact is a disrupted cephalic furrow that only buckles with the appearance of mitotic domains. -->

<!--The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.-->

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process. That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process caused by the germ band was not.-->

<!--Why is that mitotic domains occur in patches rather than synchronized as the previous cycles? One possibility is that mitotic domains can interfere with with morphogenetic movements. Therefore, it would not work if all cells would divide at the same time while the tissue tries to fold and invaginate. Breaking up the mitotic divisions in limited patches is probably good for simultaneous. Since the head has almost no movements, there are a lot of domains there. -->

<!--Overall, our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.-->

<!--Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila. The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.-->

# Methods

## Fly genetics

We generated fluorescent cephalic furrow mutant strains by genetic crossing. We
mated flies carrying the loss-of-function alleles *btd^XA^* (FlyBase:
[FBal0030657](https://flybase.org/reports/FBal0030657), BDSC:
[#26815](https://bdsc.indiana.edu/Home/Search?presearch=26815)) and *eve^3^*
(FlyBase: [FBal0003885](https://flybase.org/reports/FBal0003885), BDSC
[#299](https://bdsc.indiana.edu/Home/Search?presearch=299)), with flies
carrying the fluorescent membrane marker GAP43-mCherry [@Martin2010-pb, gift
from Kassiani Skouloudaki]. The mutant alleles were balanced over the
fluorescent balancers FM7c-KrGFP (BDSC:
[#5193](https://bdsc.indiana.edu/Home/Search?presearch=5193)) and CyO-twiGFP
(gift from Akanksha Jain). We imaged the progeny of the established stable
lines *btd^XA^/FM7c-KrGFP;;GAP43-mCherry/MKRS;* and
*;eve^3^/CyO-twiGFP;GAP43-mCherry/MKRS;*, and used the lack of GFP signal to
distinguish homozygous embryos.

<!--TODO: Add Gap,stg recombination.-->
<!--TODO: Add TM3-KrGFP balancer.-->

## Live-imaging

We collected embryos on apple juice agar plates at 25°C and immersed in 20%
sodium hypochlorite solution (Merck 1.05614.2500) for 1.5 min to remove the
chorion. We oriented the embryos on an agar pad and attached them to a
coverslip previously covered with a thin layer of heptane glue. Using silicone
glue we attached the coverslip to a sample holder and mounted the samples in a
Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope. For imaging lateral views, we used a Zeiss
20x/1NA Plan-Apochromat Water objective and acquired z-stacks of 0.X pixel size
and 3µm z-step covering one side of the embryo. For imaging dorsal views, we
used a Zeiss 40x/?NA Plan-Apochromat Water objective acquiring z-stacks of 0.X
pixel size and 1.5--3µm z-step covering the middle section of the embryo. The
time resolution was adjusted according to the number of embryos on the
coverslip, ranging between 45--60s. We acquired two channels simultaneously
using 488 and 561nm lasers, and an image splitter cube containing a LP560
dichromatic mirror and a LP585 emission filter. All recordings were performed
at 25°C.

## Cauterization experiments

Embryos were collected and dechorionated as described above. Movies were
obtained in a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal spinning disk, an EMCCD camera (Andor
iXon DU-888), a 60× 1.2 NA water immersion objective, and the software AndorIQ
for image acquisition. The time resolution was set in 200 ms and pixel size was
0.180556 um. Embryos were mounted laterally on MatTek glass-bottom Petri dishes
and covered in water. Experiments were performed under temperature control at
28 degrees Celsius. For laser ablations, a Titanium Sapphire Chameleon Ultra II
(Coherent) laser at 800 nm was tuned down from 80 MHz to 20 kHz using a
pulse-picker. Laser power measured before microscope port was 6 mW and pixel
dwell time for scanning was 2 us. Each scan was repeated 10 consecutive times
to make a cut along a single cell. Embryos were ablated just once each. For
analysis, kymographs were obtained using the Fiji plugin Multi_Kymograph
(https://github.com/fiji/Multi_Kymograph) on cell edges in the direction
perpendicular to the cuts. The kymographs were binarized and distance between
edges versus time was linearly fitted to obtain the recoil velocity. 

## Image processing and analyses

We converted the raw microscopy datasets into individual TIFF stacks for
downstream processing using a custom ImageJ macro in Fiji [@Schindelin2012-di;
@Rueden2017-ky]. We generated 3D renderings of the lateral surface of the
embryos using the ImageJ/Fiji plugin 3Dscript [@Schmid2019-bm]. We improved the
signal-to-noise ratio and restored the z-resolution of lateral datasets from
3µm to 1µm by training a deep learning upsampling model using CARE
[@Weigert2018-ti]. We generated cartographic projections by segmenting the
surface of the embryo with ilastik [@Berg2019-ab] and using the ImSAnE toolbox
[@Heemskerk2015-kv]. We manually traced the fold outlines and areas of lateral
3D renderings and lateral cartographic projections, respectively, using Fiji.
We used the ImageJ Temporal-Color Code script with the mpl-viridis colorscheme
to visualize the fold dynamics. To segment membranes and quantify apical cell
areas we used MorphoLibJ plugin in ImageJ [@Legland2016-cp]. To analyze the
tortuosity of the epithelium we straightened the vitelline envelope using the
Straighten tool in ImageJ, and applied gaussian blur and thresholding to
extract the outline of the epithelium in dorsal views. We used custom Python
and R scripts to generate plots, and Inkscape to assemble the figure plates and
illustrations.

embryos. (A) Overview of the epithelial dynamics in control (*btd*
heterozygote) and mutant embryos (*btd* and *eve* homozygotes). (B) Timing of
key developmental events comparing wild type development and cephalic furrow
mutants. Ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* form later and unfold quicker than
the cephalic furrow in normal development, and their formation coincides with
the appearance of mitotic domains. Arrows indicate the cephalic furrow,
arrowheads indicate the ectopic folds, and asterisks indicate the position of
mitotic domains. Developmental staging based on
