# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila melanogaster* during gastrulation. Despite being a
prominent trait, the mechanisms and forces controlling the formation of the
cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we investigate the morphogenesis and
developmental role of the cephalic furrow in the global context of gastrulation
by analyzing mutant embryos under live-imaging. We find that embryos which fail
to initiate the cephalic furrow invariably form late ectopic folds at the
head--trunk interface. They differ from a normal cephalic furrow and are
variable between embryos. We show the formation of ectopic folds results from
the combined physical interactions acting locally through the expansion of
apical cell areas caused by mitotic domains, and globally through the
compression of tissues driven by the elongating germ band. Our findings suggest
the cephalic furrow counteracts such epithelial instability by priming the
position of folding at a predictable position at the head--trunk boundary.

<!--The cephalic furrow background-->

The cephalic furrow is a prominent morphogenetic movement of *Drosophila*
gastrulation. It is a deep invagination that appear as lateral indentations at
the onset of gastrulation [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw]. It covers from
dorsal to ventral and subdivides the yolk from head and trunk almost entirely.
Unlike the ventral furrow, however, the cephalic furrow is a transient
structure that unfolds after a couple of hours, and the invaginated tissue is
not associated with any particular fate in the embryo. This prominent but
ephemeral nature makes the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic traits of
gastrulation, both in terms of the processes controlling its formation and its
physical developmental role.

<!--The morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow-->

The morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is poorly understood
[@Gilmour2017-um]. The cephalic furrow begins with a single row of initiator
cells that sink into the yolk. The process occurs through a coordinated series
of cell shape changes and tissue movements, beginning with the shortening of
initiator cells and basal expansion, and a second step which develops into a
progressive invagination [@Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi]. This process
differs from other movements and remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um;
@Vincent1997-fa], but is highly stereotypic. The cephalic furrow is positioned
with 1% precision [@Liu2013-lc], a patterning that could be achieved with only
four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf], suggesting there is precise genetic patterning
coordinating the cephalic furrow formation in space and time.

<!--Cephalic furrow mechanics-->

The physical role that the deep invagination of the cephalic furrow play in the
complex morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation remain elusive.
Modeling simulations have suggested the cephalic furrow can act as an anchor to
the tissue [@Allena2012-pb]. Others have speculated that the cephalic furrow
might balance the germ band extension [@PhysicalHypotheses]. However, the
interactions of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not
been investigated [@Kong2017-ac], and its role in the global context of
gastrulation and the interplay between patterning and morphogenesis remain
open.

<!--Cephalic furrow patterning-->

Two genes are known to be required to specify the cephalic furrow---buttonhead
(btd) and even-skipped (eve). Loss of function exhibit strong phenotypes where
the cephalic furrow fails to initiate [@Vincent1997-fa]. In addition, paired
(prd) embryos exhibit weak phenotypes where the formation of the cephalic
furrow is delayed, but a fold is still formed [@Blankenship2001-tm].
Intriguingly, however, eve mutants still form a late fold near the cephalic
furrow position [@Vincent1997-fa]. However, the origin of such ectopic folds,
either genetic as reminiscent of the cephalic furrow patterning, or simply
mechanical remained unknown.

<!--The overlap between btd and eve stripe 1 specifies the initiator cells that begin the cephalic furrow [@Vincent]. The patterning is inherently noisy, but a tight coupling of morphogenetic feedback achieves a single precise row of initiator cells [@Eritano]. -->

<!--This study-->

To investigate the developmental roles of the cephalic furrow morphogenesis to
Drosophila gastrulation, we analyzed effects of disruptions in cephalic furrow
formation to other gastrulation movements using live-imaging and laser
cauterizations in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Summary of findings-->

We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow---not only *eve*
mutants but also *btd* mutants---invariably form late ectopic folds at the
head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ in timing, formation
dynamics, folded area, and morphology to the cephalic furrow, suggesting they
are indeed formed by different processes. The position and timing of folding
events varies between individual mutant embryos, but correlates with the
position of mitotic domains, and the epithelium often buckles abruptly between
the dividing cells with expanded apical areas, suggesting that local tissue
forces might cause the tissue to buckle.

To tested whether the local tissue forces driven by mitotic domains are causing
the ectopic folds, we analyzed double mutant embryos for stg btd and stg eve
which form neither the cephalic furrow nor the mitotic domains in cycle 14. We
find that ectopic folds are still formed in stg btd and stg eve double mutants,
suggesting that mitotic domains might influence the position, or facilitate the
folding, but are not required, suggesting that other tissue forces might be the
driving force for ectopic folds.

Next we asked whether the compression of tissues caused by the elongating germ
band could be driving ectopic fold formation. We tested this hypothesis by
blocking the germ band extension by cauterizing the posterodorsal region in
mutant embryos. We find the ectopic folds are absent when the germ band is
mechanically blocked by the cauterization, suggesting that the global tissue
compression caused by the germ band extension is the main force contributing to
the formation of ectopic folds.

Given the unexpected finding that the germ band influences head tissues, we
then tested whether the germ band extension and its resulting tissue
compression also contributes to the normal process of cephalic furrow
formation. We find that cauterized wild type embryos have a shallower cephalic
furrow, indicating that the tissue compression from the germ band extension
affects the amount of invaginated cephalic furrow tissue.

Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation where the extension
of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk interface. This
interaction under normal embryogenesis pushes the cephalic furrow invagination
deeper in the yolk, providing a previously unknown physical component to the
cephalic furrow morphogenesis initiated independently by genetic means. Thus
revealing a global interaction between morphogenetic movements in Drosophila
gastrulation.

Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary,
to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic
furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow
accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ
band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable
invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus
preventing erratic epithelial buckling.

Overall, overall our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a
two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process
of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band
extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to
orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.

# Results

## Cephalic furrow mutants form ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary

<!--Ectopic folds occur in CF mutants-->

We analyzed embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow under
live-imaging to understand how the absence of the cephalic furrow impacts
gastrulation. btd and eve are two key genes required for the specification of
the initiator cells [@Vincent1997-fa]. It was known that eve mutants form a
late fold, but its origins remain unclear. We find that not only eve mutants,
but also btd mutants, which fail to initiate the cephalic furrow, invariably
form ectopic epithelial folds at the head--trunk interface (Figure
@fig:ectopic-folding). We analyzed them to understand what is causing the
formation of this folds, a reminiscent activity from the cephalic furrow
patterning or a consequence of mechanical forces during gastrulation.

<!--Ectopic folds are delayed relative to CF formation-->

The formation of ectopic folds is delayed in relation to the native cephalic
furrow. While the cephalic furrow initiates at the onset of gastrulation in
wild type embryos (stage 6), the ectopic folds in btd and eve mutants appear
once the germ band has already progressed about X% (stage 8) (Figure
@fig:ectopic-folding, Video 1 and 2).

## Ectopic fold formation and morphology differs from the cephalic furrow

<!--Morphology of ectopic folds differ from CF invagination-->

The morphology of the ectopic folds differ from the wild type invagination. The
folded tissue is less symmetric than the cephalic furrow, the cleft at the
leading edges of the fold is wider, and the typical cell type structure is
absent, for example, wedge shape at the invagination tip, the orthogonal
position of middle cells, and the elongated morphology at the leading edges are
absent (Figure @fig:ectopic-folding).

<!--Progression of ectopic folds differ from CF formation-->

The dynamics of ectopic fold formation also differs from the cephalic furrow
invagination. While the cephalic furrow initiates as a straight lateral line
and progressively performs a dorsal posterior shift, a ventral anterior shift,
and a shape bending into a curved line, the ectopic folds are mostly straight
and do not undergo a determined patterned shift or shape change (Figure
@fig:ectopic-variability).

<!--Ectopic folding area smaller than CF invagination area-->

The area of folded tissue in ectopic folds differ from the cephalic furrow
invagination. We measured the total area of folded tissue and find it is
roughly half the size of a regular wild type cephalic furrow. There is a
minimum value of invaginated tissues in mutant embryos (Figure
@fig:ectopic-variability).

<!--Depth of ectopic folds is smaller than CF depth-->

In addition, we measured the depth of ectopic folds compared to the cephalic
furrow. We found similarly that the maximum depth of ectopic folds is about
half of the cephalic furrow invagination @fig:ectopic-variability).

<!--The shape of folds is different as evidenced by a local curvature plot.-->

## Ectopic folding is variable among individual mutant embryos

<!--Ectopic folds vary between individual mutant embryos-->

To understand the causes of ectopic folding in btd and eve mutants, we imaged
and analyzed different mutant individuals to see if ectopic folds form at
regular positions and timing. We find that the formation dynamics and position
of these ectopic folds is variable between individual mutant embryos (Figure
@fig:ectopic-variability). Even between left and right side of the same embryo.
This suggest they are driven by patterning, or if they are stochastic, which
suggest they are driven by mechanical forces. 

<!--TODO: Include panel with left-right differences-->

<!--Position of ectopic folding is biased-->

<!--TODO: Find a good plot to demonstrate this-->

The ectopic folds can occur near the canonical cephalic furrow position, but it
also forms in at least one more anterior site and two more posterior positions.
In btd mutants, the ectopic folds near the canonical cephalic furrow position.
The ectopic folds in eve mutants also occur in the anterior and canonical
positions, but the more posterior folds occur more dorsally compared to btd.

<!--Compensation of tissue compression-->

We observe that individual mutant embryos can have the same total invaginated
area either having one deep fold or two shallower folds.

## Ectopic folding coincides with the formation of mitotic domains

<!--Ectopic folds appear between mitotic domains-->

To understand what influences the position and timing of ectopic folding, we
analyzed the placement of these events in relation to epithelial features. We
find a correlation between the formation of ectopic folds with the position and
timing of mitotic domains at the head--trunk interface (Figure
@fig:mitotic-domains). The ectopic folds in btd and eve mutants are often
positioned between adjacent mitotic domains (Figure @fig:mitotic-domains).

<!--Ectopic folding coincides with area expansion of dividing cells-->

The epithelial cells that fold are being compressed by the expansion of
dividing cells. The ectopic folding coincides in position and timing with the
expansion in the area of dividing cells during mitosis (Figure
@fig:mitotic-domains). The apical area of epithelial cells about to fold
inwards diminishes at the same time that the apical area of dividing cells
increase.

<!--Ectopic folds form by tissue buckling rather than invagination-->

The process of ectopic fold formation differs from the cephalic furrow
invagination. While the cephalic furrow forms by a progressive invagination,
the ectopic folds form by abrupt buckling of the tissue (Figure
@fig:buckling-process). The ectopic folds can be initiated by reminiscent
initiator cell behavior in btd mutants. In this case, the epithelium bulges,
but does not invaginate, until it buckles with the expansion of area in
dividing cells in the mitotic domains. In other ectopic folds, the epithelium
simply buckles when compressed by adjacent dividing cells. Therefore, even
though ectopic folds might appear similar to the cephalic furrow, the
morphogenetic processes and driving forces giving rise to these folds are
rather different.

## Inhibiting mitotic domains does (not) suppress tissue buckling

To investigate whether mitotic domains are required to cause tissue buckling,
we generated double mutants for btd and stg and eve and stg. We imaged double
mutants and found that without the mitotic domains, the tissue does (not)
buckle. That means that other mechanical forces could be contributing to the
tissue buckling.

## Blocking the germ band extension suppresses tissue buckling in mutants and wild type

We tested whether the elongation of the germ band could be the external force
causing the ectopic  epithelial folds in cephalic furrow mutants. To test that
we physically blocked the germ band extension using laser cauterizations at the
posterior dorsal of the embryo at the onset of gastrulation (Figure
@fig:germband-cauterizations).

We find that when the germ band is mechanically prevented from elongating in
cephalic furrow mutants, the ectopic folds no longer appear in the head-trunk
interface (Figure @fig:germband-cauterizations, Videos). The mitotic domains
and associated apical area expansion occur normally and compress apically
non-dividing cells (Figure @fig:germband-cauterizations, Video). This
response is consistent in both btd and eve mutants (Supplemental figure)

<!--Impact of germ band cauterization in wild type-->

Next, we asked whether the germ band elongation could be contributing to the
invagination of the cephalic furrow by exerting forces on the epithelium in
wild type embryos (see He ventral furrow). To test this hypothesis, we blocked
the germ band elongation in wild type embryos by cauterization prior to
gastrulation.

We found that in embryos with a successful cauterization the cephalic furrow
invagination is about 10% shallower compared to control embryos
(@fig:germband-cauterizations). The cephalic furrow length and germ band
extension show a weak but significant correlation. This indicates the physical
force exerted by the germ band extension also contributes to the cephalic
furrow invagination in normal embryogenesis, suggesting the cephalic furrow
morphogenesis is governed by the orchestration of genetic patterning with
mechanical forces in the embryo.

<!--Model shows expansion combined with compression is important-->

To understand the interplay of epithelial forces at the head-trunk boundary in
vivo, we developed an in silico model. Modelling the tissue forces and
compressions we obtain ectopic folding in variable stochastic positions, and
the tissue only buckles when the expansion of apical area is coordinated with
external forces from the germ band (@fig:germband-cauterizations).

# Discussion

## Cephalic furrow cryptic mutants due to ectopic folding

The cephalic furrow has not been as studied as other morphogenetic movements in
Drosophila gastrulation. Only a few cephalic furrow mutants have been
identified and the mechanisms of patterning and morphogenesis remain
understudied to this day. Part of the reason is that the cephalic furrow is a
transient structure and to identify mutant phenotypes one has to image its
formation, since there are no known consequences of not forming the cephalic
furrow. Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be able to investigate the
cephalic furrow formation.

Using live-imaging, we found that cephalic furrow mutants with a delayed furrow
in fact fail to form the invagination, but still form a ectopic fold at the
canonical cephalic furrow position. We describe this for gt and there are
likely other genes that might be affecting the cephalic furrow development, but
are cryptic because it requires live-imaging.

## The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone prone to epithelial instability

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is characterized by a
boundary of tissue movements. The forces involved are a relatively static head
tissues that undergo expansion due to mitotic domains, and an anterior and
ventral flow of trunk tissues driven by the germ band elongation.
The invaginated area analysis suggests some sort of compensation in the amount
of invaginated tissue. Suggesting that mechanical forces acting in the
monolayer epithelia, such as the expansion of dividing cells, or the
compression exerted by the germ band, might be causally connected to the tissue
buckling.

## Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains but ultimately driven by germ band elongation

This indicates the germ band extension is the driving force underlying the
ectopic epithelial folding, and that mitotic domains facilitate but are not
sufficient to cause the tissue to buckle. By cauterization experiments we show
the germ band extension causes epithelial compression at the head-trunk
boundary. While in strong phenotypes, embryos that fail to initiate the furrow,
the compression results in ectopic folds, in wild type embryos the compression
further deepens the furrow. This shows evidence of the long range global impact
the germ band extension exerts during gastrulation.

## Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position

Therefore, the role that the cephalic furrow appears to accomplish during
gastrulation is to anticipate these conflicts and prime, in a predictable
manner, the position that the tissue will fold. In doing so, the cephalic
furrow would prevent potential defects associated with erratic buckling, such
as the compromise of cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling in the
epithelia, and thus ensure a stereotypical balance of forces required for the
precise patterning of embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes

The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement
initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 µm wide, as
supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further
deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the
head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type
and mutants.

Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an
active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process.
That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are
identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the
process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process
caused by the germ band was not.

## Conclusions

Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions
involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in
Drosophila.

The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical
parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving
insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that
control morphogenesis.
