# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila melanogaster* during gastrulation. Despite being a
prominent trait, the mechanisms and forces controlling the formation of the
cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we investigate the developmental role of
the cephalic furrow in the global context of gastrulation by live imaging
mutant embryos under lightsheet microscopy. We find that embryos lacking a
cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds in variable positions at the
head--trunk interface. We show the formation of ectopic folds is the result of
the concomitant epithelial expansion generated by mitotic domains, with the
compression driven by the germ band elongation. We propose the cephalic furrow
act as a buffer to these opposing tissue interactions by priming the position
of folding at the head--trunk boundary early in gastrulation.

# Introduction

<!--The head--trunk boundary is an ancient and essential trait for the evolution of bilaterians.-->

<!--The cephalic furrow background-->

The cephalic furrow is a prominent epithelial invagination that forms at the
head--trunk boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. Together with the
ventral furrow, the cephalic furrow is one of the first morphogenetic movements
in the embryo [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw]. It begins as lateral
indentations which quickly extend to the dorsal and ventral sides, and
invaginate deep into the yolk sac. Unlike the ventral furrow, however, the
invaginated cells do not give rise to any particular tissue, and the cephalic
furrow unfolds after a couple of hours of gastrulation. This prominent but
ephemeral existence makes the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic traits
of gastrulation.

<!--This process differs from other movements [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa]. -->

<!--This process remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Cephalic furrow patterning and morphogenesis-->

The cephalic furrow formation is genetically determined. It is regulated by the
zygotic expression of *buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*). The
overlap between *btd* expression in the head and *eve* stripe 1 is required to
the specification of the initiator cells [@Vincent1997-fa]. This thin row of
initiator cells undergo a coordinated series of cell shape changes, beginning
with cell shortening and followed by basal expansion. These cells sink below
the epithelial basal lamina and the surrounding tissues progressively
invaginate into the yolk [@Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi]. The position of
the cephalic furrow specified with incredible precision of 1% the embryo length
[@Liu2013-lc], and a mechanical coupling between epithelial cells ensures the
precision of the fold [@Eritano2020-mi]. These findings highlight the precise
genetic patterning in place coordinating the stereotypic formation of the
cephalic furrow in space and time.

<!--a patterning that can be achieved with only four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf]-->

<!--The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead* (*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve* embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination [@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow physical role-->

Despite increasing understanding of how the cephalic furrow forms, it is less
clear what developmental role this deep invagination plays during gastrulation.
Numerical approaches to understand the global gastrulation dynamics suggest the
cephalic furrow plays a global role to the complex morphogenetic movements of
gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb; @Dicko2017-wz]. The cephalic furrow can act as a
barrier to the tissue flows and has a global effect in orienting the germ band
extension towards the posterior [@Dicko2017-wz]. However, the interactions of
the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not been
investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac], and its physical role in the global
dynamics of *Drosophila* gastrulation remains poorly understood.

<!--A tissue fold can put epithelial cells in close contact and initiate cell-to-cell communication important for the patterning of blastoderm cells, but so far there is no evidence.-->

<!--Approach of this study-->

To investigate this question, we analyzed how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary and
the global gastrulation dynamics using live-imaging and laser cauterizations in
cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Summary of findings-->

We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow form late
ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ from the
cephalic furrow in timing, formation dynamics, folded area, and morphology. The
number and position of ectopic folds across the anteroposterior axis varies
between individual mutant embryos. We show the timing and position of ectopic
folds correlates with the formation of mitotic domains, suggesting that local
tissue interactions are causing the tissue to buckle. These local interactions,
however, are not sufficient to generate ectopic folds. Using laser
cauterizations to mechanically block the germ band extension, we show the
occurrence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary depends on the global
tissue compression caused by the germ band extension, and that this interaction
also contributes to the cephalic furrow formation in normal embryogenesis.

Our analyses reveal the head--trunk boundary is a convergent zone of tissue
interactions during gastrulation being orchestrated by two morphogenetic
events, the mitotic domains causing the expansion of head tissues, and the germ
band causing the compression of trunk tissues. Without the formation of the
cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary will
inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably. Thus, we propose the
cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming
the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains
part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the
head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about
the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating
morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.

# Results

<!--## Cephalic furrow mutants form variable ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary-->

<!--Context for late folds in CF mutants-->

We studied cephalic furrow mutants to understand how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impact the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary during
gastrulation. In *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos, the cephalic furrow fails to
invaginate and is entirely absent, but a late fold appears in the cephalic
region of *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa]. To understand the origin of this
late fold and verify if they also form in *btd* mutants, we generated flies
with a fluorescent background and the loss-of-function alleles for *btd* or
*eve*. We then acquired *in toto* live imaging data of mutant embryos using
lightsheet microscopy, and analyzed the pattern, dynamics, and variability of
folding events compared to the cephalic furrow formation. 

<!--TODO: Tissue flow analyses without CF-->

We analyzed the tissue flows in cephalic furrow mutants (homozygotes) in
comparison to sibling controls (heterozygotes) using PIV analysis. In wild type
embryogenesis the region of the head--trunk boundary shows a characteristic
pattern at the onset of gastrulation (before germ band extension and mitotic
domains). There is a strong flow towards the ventral region at the lateral
epithelium due to the ventral furrow invagination, while the head tissues and
dorsal trunk tissues have no direction. Once the cephalic furrow initiates it
directs the flow towards ventral of the dorsal tissues and a clockwise flow
pattern in the head, with dorsal tissues moving posteriorly and ventrally while
ventral head tissues move anteriorly and dorsally. The center of the hurricane
sits at the ventral portion of the head region just anterior to the cephalic
furrow. In the absence of the cephalic furrow, the ventral flow is restricted
to more posterior trunk tissues, while head tissues show more variable
directions despite also flowing dorsally. These analysis the flow pattern is
disrupted in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Late ectopic folds form in CF mutants-->

Our live imaging data corroborate the presence of late folds in *eve* mutants,
and reveals that *btd* embryos also form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk
interface during gastrulation (@fig:ectopic). We first detect ectopic folds
late during gastrulation. While the cephalic furrow in wild type embryos forms
in stage 6, at the onset of gastrulation, the ectopic folds in mutant embryos
only appear in stage 8, when the germ band has already extended at least a
third of the embryo length ({@fig:ectopic}A, Video 1 and 2). Unlike the
stereotypic morphology of the cephalic furrow, the ectopic folds are often
asymmetric, have a looser cleft between edges, and lack the typical cell shapes
at the invagination tip and edges ({@fig:ectopic}B). The ectopic folds are thus
late and with irregular morphology.

<!--TODO: Figure with shape analysis of ectopic folds.-->

<!--Ectopic folds vary between individual mutant embryos-->

We traced the formation of ectopic folds at the head--trunk epithelia to
quantify the number, the position, the dynamics and the total area of folding
events in individual mutant embryos. We find the number of ectopic folds varies
between one to four on each side of mutant embryos, and that mutants without
ectopic folds were rare (Table X). In addition, the position of folding events
along the head--trunk interface also varies from embryo-to-embryo. We compiled
and normalized the tracing data, and analyzed the distribution of folding
events between mutant embryos, and find the position of ectopic folds vary
greatly compared to the position of the cephalic furrow formation on the
lateral blastoderm ({@fig:variability}I). The formation of ectopic folds can
even differ between the left and right side of the same embryo
({@fig:variability}J). Thus, in contrast to the predictability of the cephalic
furrow, the formation of ectopic folds varies from embryo to embryo.

<!--The ectopic folds, either in *btd* or in *eve* mutants, can occur near the canonical cephalic furrow region, but also occur in more anterior or more posterior positions.-->

<!--This variability is in stark contrast to the stereotypic formation of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis, suggesting the process of ectopic fold formation might be driven by stochastic events and mechanical forces in the epithelial tissue.-->

<!--TODO: Table with main annotated datasets-->

<!--Dynamics of ectopic folds is different from CF-->

We then analyzed the dynamics of ectopic folds from formation to unfolding. The
cephalic furrow initiates as a straight orthogonal line whose dorsal portion
progressively shifts to the posterior, while its ventral portion shifts to the
anterior, the invagination extends to the dorsal and ventral sides bending the
initial straight line ({@fig:variability}A). In contrast, the ectopic folds
generally appear tilted with an angle (not orthogonal) to the anteroposterior
axis, they remain straight over time not bending, and they stay within the
lateral portion without extending as far dorsal or ventral as the cephalic
furrow ({@fig:variability}B,C). Thus, the dynamics of ectopic fold formation
differ from the canonical cephalic furrow formation.

<!--Ectopic folding area and depth smaller than CF invagination-->

Finally, we estimated the area of epithelial tissue inside the ectopic folds.
We first projected the surface of the embryo as a flat surface, backtracked
visually the infolded cells of individual ectopic folds of mutant embryos, and
demarcated the folded region on the blastoderm before gastrulation
({@fig:variability}D--F). We measured the area of individual ectopic folds and
the total folded area per embryo. We find that both ectopic folds and the total
area of folded tissue per embryo in *btd* and *eve* mutants is roughly half
that of the invaginated area of the cephalic furrow in sibling controls
({@fig:variability}G). We have also directly measured the depth of ectopic
folds in frontal view datasets, and obtained the same result that ectopic folds
are shallower than the cephalic furrow invagination ({@fig:variability}H). The
amount of tissue that folds in ectopic folds is smaller than in wild type
embryogenesis with the cephalic furrow.

<!--TODO: We observe that individual mutant embryos can have the same total invaginated area either having one deep fold or two shallower folds.-->

<!--Concluding differentness of ectopic folds-->

Overall, we describe that embryos lacking the cephalic furrow form late ectopic
folds. The formation of ectopic folds is different from the cephalic furrow in
terms of number, position, dynamics and area. Importantly, ectopic fold
formation is variable across embryos, in stark contrast to the stereotypic
cephalic furrow formation in controls and wild type. These analyses indicate
the formation of ectopic folds is driven by different developmental mechanisms
than the cephalic furrow, possibly influenced by stochastic events and
mechanical forces in the epithelial tissue.

<!--TODO: Analyses of tissue flow in the absence of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--We analyzed the tissue flow in cephalic furrow mutants using particle image velocimetry. We find that without the cephalic furrow the head--trunk boundary region remains static against the movement of the trunk tissues.-->

## Ectopic folds form next to mitotic domains

<!--Ectopic folds appear between mitotic domains-->

To uncover what determines the position and formation of ectopic folds, we
analyzed the tissue dynamics at the head--trunk boundary in *btd* and *eve*
mutants, and found a correlation between the ectopic folds and mitotic domains
(MD)---groups of blastoderm cells that divide in synchrony [@Foe1989-cw].

<!--TODO: Quantify how many are next to MD-->

Ectopic folds in mutant embryos form next to or in between mitotic domains
(@fig:mitotic). A common position for the formation of ectopic folds is near
the canonical place of the cephalic furrow formation. In *btd* embryos this
ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD7 (*btd* mutants lack MD2
[@Edgar1994-pi]). In *eve* embryos this ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD2
(*eve* mutants have an expanded MD2 [@Vincent1997-fa]). Ectopic folds also form
at a more anterior position, between between MD1 and MD9/MD5 in both *btd* and
*eve* mutants. The posterior-most ectopic fold we detect forms posterior to MD6
({@fig:mitotic}A--C). More rarely *btd* embryos form a shallower fold between
MD7 and MD6. Thus, these observations indicate the position of ectopic folds is
variable but not random; they are in most cases associated with the mitotic
domains.

<!--Ectopic folding coincides with area expansion of dividing cells-->
<!--Ectopic folds form by tissue buckling rather than invagination-->

The timing of ectopic folding also coincides with mitotic domains. We analyzed
the apical area of cells during ectopic fold formation. The apices of the
epithelial cells about to fold inwards are compressed progressively by the
apical expansion of dividing cells in the adjacent mitotic domains
({@fig:mitotic}D). The expansion of dividing cells thus always precede the
formation of the ectopic folds, and they form by abrupt buckling of the tissue
instead of the progressive invagination characteristic of the cephalic furrow
({@fig:mitotic}E). Thus, we find the formation of ectopic folds only occurs
after the epithelial compression caused by the apical expansion of mitotic
cells. Also the dynamics of the process is rather different than the cephalic
furrow, even though the end result---an epithelial fold---might appear similar.

<!--TODO: Quantify the apical area for ectopic fold surroundings-->

<!--TODO: Panel showing apical area upon ectopic fold formation-->

<!--The only exception occurs in the canonical cephalic furrow position of *btd* embryos where we detect the narrowing of apical cell area before expansion of adjacent mitotic domains (see @slppaper), although the tissue only folds when the cells in adjacent mitotic domains undergo area expansion during mitosis.-->

<!--Concluding mitotic coincidence and buckling-->

We thus find a correlation in space and time between the formation of mitotic
domains and ectopic folds. This tissue dynamics and the cell shape analysis
indicate that local mechanical forces in the tissue play a role in ectopic fold
formation in *btd* and *eve* mutants.

## Tissue compression generated by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation

<!--## Ectopic fold formation is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by the germ band extension-->

<!--## Concomitant expansion of head tissues by the mitotic domains and compression of trunk tissues by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--Double mutants without mitotic domains and cephalic furrow-->

To test whether the tissue expansion generated by mitotic domains play a role
in the formation of ectopic folds, we generated double mutant embryos lacking
the cephalic furrow and the mitotic domains. We combined our fluorescent lines
carrying the loss of function alleles for *btd* and *eve* with a loss of
function allele for *stg*, a gene that regulates the formation of mitotic
domains in the nuclear cycle 14 [@Edgar1989-hv]. **[Hypothetical outcome]** We
then imaged *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants using our lightsheet
pipeline as before.

We find the ectopic folds are still present in double mutant embryos which lack
mitotic domains (@fig:double). We observe, however, a different distribution of
folding events when compared to the single mutant embryos. This indicates that
mitotic domains are not required but bias the position and formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants, the ectopic folds are absent, suggesting the presence of mitotic domains is necessary for the formation of ectopic folds. This indicates they play a key role in the balance of local forces that lead to the formation of ectopic folds. -->

<!--Cauterization experiment to test germ band influence-->

The presence of ectopic folds in double mutants indicate that other mechanical
forces acting during gastrulation are driving the formation of ectopic folds at
the head--trunk interface. A previous observation, the formation of an ectopic
fold posterior to MD6 against compressed epithelial cells in the dorsal trunk
region (Figure x), suggested the germ band extension could driving the
formation of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary in the absence of the
cephalic furrow. We thus tested this hypothesis by physically blocking the germ
band from extending in *btd* and *eve* mutants using tissue cauterizations, and
by analyzing the epithelial morphology (@fig:mutcauts).

<!--Blocking the germ band extension suppresses ectopic folds-->

We find the mutant embryos embryos where the germ band is mechanically blocked
show no ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary. In contrast to
non-cauterized embryos, cauterized embryos show a regular epithelium outline
without deformations ({@fig:mutcauts}A,D,E). The main tissue movements are
driven by the mitotic domains which are still present ({@fig:mutcauts}A). The
dividing cells still expand their apical area and compress the non-dividing
surrounding cells in cauterized mutant embryos. However, this compression is
insufficient to cause the tissue to buckle ({@fig:mutcauts}B,C and Video X).
Thus, the germ band extension is required for the formation of ectopic folds in
*btd* and *eve* mutants.

<!--TODO: Measure epithelial straightness in cauterization experiments-->

<!--TODO: Estimate the expansion of head tissues in cauterized embryo-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

These experiments show the main driving force for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants comes from the global compression of trunk
tissues caused by the elongating germ band. When mitotic domains are present,
the dividing cells increase the local tissue interactions creating areas prone
to buckling, which bias the formation of ectopic folds. However, the germ band
extension is what drives the formation of ectopic folds.

## Active pull drives cephalic furrow invagination during normal embryogenesis with small input from the germ band extension 

<!--Mitotic domains and germ band interactions in wild type-->

The finding that the germ band extension interacts with head tissues, led us to
ask whether the invagination of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis
is also pushed by the germ band elongation. Historical observations already
suggested that mitotic domains and the germ band could contribute to the
cephalic furrow invagination [@Campos-Ortega1997-rd], and a recent work shows
the completion of the ventral furrow depends on the physical push from the
adjacent ectoderm [@Guo2021-sj]. To understand how the germ band extension
interacts with the cephalic furrow formation, we performed laser ablations and
cauterizations in wild type at different locations in the embryo.

<!--Laser ablations in wild type suggest active CF-->

To understand the mechanical properties of the tissues surrounding the cephalic
furrow, we first quantified the force the cephalic furrow creates during the
invagination process using laser ablations. We measured the recoil velocity in
the epithelium anterior and posterior to the cephalic furrow (Figure laser
ablation illustration). We find the recoil velocity of cell membranes decrease
with the distance to the initiator cells (Figure panel laser ablation). The
recoil velocity becomes negligible at a distance of 40 ¬µm from the initiator
cells. This indicates the invagination of the cephalic furrow actively pulls
the epithelial cells at the onset of gastrulation within a region 80 ¬µm wide of
the head--trunk blastoderm.

<!--Analyses of mitotic domain single mutants-->

**[Hypothetical outcome]** We then investigated whether the local expansion
caused by mitotic domains could influence the depth of the cephalic furrow. We
measured the depth of the cephalic furrow in *stg* mutants. We find initial
invagination of the cephalic furrow in *stg* mutants shows no differences in
depth from control embryos. We also observe an anterior shift in the cephalic
furrow position in *stg* embryos. This anterior shift coincides with the
progression of the germ band towards the head region which lacks the expansion
of head tissues due to the absence of mitotic domains.

<!--Cauterization of wild type indicate mild GB to CF depth-->

We then tested whether the force generated by the germ band extension
contributes to the cephalic furrow invagination. We blocked the germ band
elongation in wild type embryos using our cauterization approach and measured
the depth of the cephalic furrow invagination. We find the cephalic furrow in
cauterized embryos is about 10% shallower than non-cauterized embryos
(@fig:wildcauts). This indicates a mild influence of the germ band extension in
the process of cephalic furrow invagination.

<!--GB influence in the position and dynamics of CF-->

The cauterization, however, has consequences to the dynamics and position of
the cephalic furrow. We observe that in cauterized embryos there is a posterior
shift in the dorsal portion of the cephalic furrow (@fig:wildcauts). This
posterior shift occurs with expansion of head tissues associated with the
initiation of mitotic domains. In non-cauterized embryos, the dorsal shift of
the cephalic furrow is contained by the expansion of the germ band. Despite not
having a significant effect in the depth of the cephalic furrow, the tissue
interactions at the dorsal portion of the embryo are influenced by the germ
band extension.

<!--Curiously, if the cauterization is unequal, the depth of the cephalic furrow on the left and right side are different. -->

<!--Cephalic furrow is mostly autonomous but interactions matter-->

Overall, these results show that in normal embryogenesis the morphogenesis of
the cephalic is mainly driven by itself, specified and mediated genetically and
autonomously, with the mitotic domains and germ band extension contributing a
minor role in pushing the cephalic furrow. However, we observe that when the
mitotic domains are absent, or the germ band extension is blocked, the tissue
dynamics at the head--trunk boundary are affected. We thus suggest the cephalic
furrow morphogenesis is largely governed by the orchestration of genetic
patterning with a minor role of the mechanical forces in the embryo.

## In silico linear 1D model reproduces in vivo observations

**[Hypothetical outcome]** To complement our in vivo observations and
understand the interplay between local and global tissue interactions, we
developed a 1D linear model that represents the epithelium of a gastrulating
embryo. We adapted a previous model [@previousmodel] and reached the set of
parameters that reproduced epithelial behavior in different conditions in vivo.
We asked if the symmetry of the cephalic furrow invagination is more pronounced
than that of non-cauterized. And what is the weight of local, neighboring, and
global forces for the formation of ectopic folds. The model also predicts the
existence of yolk ({@fig:mutcauts}F).

# Discussion

## The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone prone to epithelial instability

The cephalic furrow has not been as studied as other morphogenetic movements in
Drosophila gastrulation. Only a few cephalic furrow mutants have been
identified and the mechanisms of patterning and morphogenesis remain
understudied to this day. Part of the reason is that the cephalic furrow is a
transient structure and to identify mutant phenotypes one has to image its
formation, since there are no known consequences of not forming the cephalic
furrow. Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be able to investigate the
cephalic furrow formation.

<!--Cephalic furrow cryptic mutants due to ectopic folding-->

Using live-imaging, we found that cephalic furrow mutants with a delayed furrow
in fact fail to form the invagination, but still form a ectopic fold at the
canonical cephalic furrow position. We describe this for gt and there are
likely other genes that might be affecting the cephalic furrow development, but
are cryptic because it requires live-imaging.

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is characterized by a
boundary of tissue movements. The forces involved are a relatively static head
tissues that undergo expansion due to mitotic domains, and an anterior and
ventral flow of trunk tissues driven by the germ band elongation.
The invaginated area analysis suggests some sort of compensation in the amount
of invaginated tissue. Suggesting that mechanical forces acting in the
monolayer epithelia, such as the expansion of dividing cells, or the
compression exerted by the germ band, might be causally connected to the tissue
buckling.

## Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by germ band elongation

This indicates the germ band extension is the driving force underlying the
ectopic epithelial folding, and that mitotic domains facilitate but are not
sufficient to cause the tissue to buckle. By cauterization experiments we show
the germ band extension causes epithelial compression at the head-trunk
boundary. While in strong phenotypes, embryos that fail to initiate the furrow,
the compression results in ectopic folds, in wild type embryos the compression
further deepens the furrow. This shows evidence of the long range global impact
the germ band extension exerts during gastrulation.

<!--Incorporate-->

Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation where the extension
of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk interface. This
interaction under normal embryogenesis pushes the cephalic furrow invagination
deeper in the yolk, providing a previously unknown physical component to the
cephalic furrow morphogenesis initiated independently by genetic means. Thus
revealing a global interaction between morphogenetic movements in Drosophila
gastrulation.

## Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position

Therefore, the role that the cephalic furrow appears to accomplish during
gastrulation is to anticipate these conflicts and prime, in a predictable
manner, the position that the tissue will fold. In doing so, the cephalic
furrow would prevent potential defects associated with erratic buckling, such
as the compromise of cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling in the
epithelia, and thus ensure a stereotypical balance of forces required for the
precise patterning of embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary,
to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic
furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow
accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ
band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable
invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus
preventing erratic epithelial buckling.

<!--## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes-->

The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement
initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 ¬µm wide, as
supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further
deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the
head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type
and mutants.

Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an
active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process.
That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are
identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the
process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process
caused by the germ band was not.

Overall, overall our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a
two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process
of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band
extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to
orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.

## Conclusions

Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions
involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in
Drosophila.

The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical
parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving
insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that
control morphogenesis.
