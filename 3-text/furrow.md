# Abstract

<!--TODO: Revise to Nature’s style-->

The cephalic furrow is a deep epithelial fold that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of flies during gastrulation [@Turner1977-ol; @Hartenstein1985-zs;
@Spencer2015-td]. The invagination forms under strict genetic control
[@Vincent1997-fa] using active cell shape changes [@Eritano2020-mi]. But the
cephalic furrow is transient and unfolds without a trace, and its function in
has remained elusive. Here we show the cephalic furrow plays a mechanical role
in *Drosophila* gastrulation. By live-imaging mutant embryos, we find the
absence of the cephalic furrow impacts the epithelial stability at the
head--trunk interface, leading to the formation of ectopic folds. Using in vivo
perturbations and in silico simulations, we show that ectopic folding occurs by
tissue buckling due to extrinsic compressive stresses generated by the
concomitant formation of mitotic domains and extension of the germ band. Our
findings suggest that in normal development the cephalic furrow absorbs the
mechanical stresses at the head--trunk boundary by priming the position of
folding, and by removing cells from the surface before other morphogenetic
movements take place. We propose the cephalic furrow prevents epithelial
instabilities during *Drosophila* gastrulation. Our findings suggest a unique
case of pre-patterned and active morphogenetic movement which has solely a
mechanical role, and which may have evolved to solve a mechanical problem.

<!--Despite forming autonomously via intrinsic cellular mechanisms [@Eritano2020-mi] under strict genetic control [@Vincent1997-fa], this head invagination is transient and vanishes without a trace.-->

<!--Our findings reveal a unique case of a pre-patterned invagination which may have evolved in response to mechanical stresses during fly evolution.-->

<!--It is a pre-patterned structure forming by active cellular mechanisms under strict genetic control. -->

<!--Our findings suggests that mechanical forces may have act as a selective pressure for morphogenesis in fly gastrulation.-->

<!--We propose the cephalic furrow invagination prevents epithelial instabilities at the head--trunk boundary, and therefore, plays a mechanical role in *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--What function this programmed invagination plays in development remains unclear.-->

<!--The cephalic furrow keeps hundreds of epithelial cells deep below the surface while the embryo gastrulates [@Stern2021-zv]. -->

<!--We find that absence of the cephalic furrow is associated with the formation of late ectopic folds on the head--trunk interface. -->

<!--We find that the absence of a head invagination negatively impacts epithelial stability.-->

<!--We show this tissue buckling is driven by two concomitant extrinsic forces, the local expansions of mitotic domains in the head, and the global compression of the germ band extension from the trunk.-->

<!--These processes increase the compressive stresses at the head--trunk interface early in gastrulation and undermine the mechanical stability of the epithelium when the cephalic furrow is absent.-->

<!--Our model suggests that priming an invagination and removing cells from the surface, effectively absorbs the mechanical forces at play.-->

<!--This suggests that in normal development, the cephalic furrow absorbs the mechanical stresses at the head--trunk boundary by priming the position of folding, and by removing cells from the surface before other morphogenetic movements take place.-->

<!--We propose the cephalic furrow invagination prevents epithelial instabilities at the head--trunk boundary, and therefore, plays a mechanical role in *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

- So the function remains a mystery

-->

<!--CF formation-->

The cephalic furrow is one of the earliest morphogenetic movements of
*Drosophila* gastrulation. It begins at the onset of blastoderm cellularization
as a lateral indentation that quickly invaginates deep into the yolk
[@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Spencer2015-td]. The resulting epithelial fold divides
the head (procephalon) from the segmented trunk (germ band) being a prominent
anatomical landmark for the embryonic head--trunk boundary
[@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw].

<!--Control of cephalic furrow formation-->

The position of the cephalic furrow is specified with remarkable accuracy
[@Liu2013-lc] under strict genetic control. Its initiation is regulated the
zygotic expression of *buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*), where
the overlap between the two determines the row of initiator cells
[@Vincent1997-fa]. The activation of lateral myosin contractility cause the
shortening of initiator cells which initiates the invagination, while the
mechanical coupling between the epithelial cells lining the furrow ensures the
precision of the tissue fold during morphogenesis [@Eritano2020-mi]. Although
the mechanisms controlling the formation of the cephalic furrow remain poorly
understood [@Gilmour2017-um], the process is under precise genetic control and
safeguarding mechanisms are in place that ensure the accuracy of morphogenesis.

<!--Putative roles of the cephalic furrow-->

Despite genetic control and active invagination mechanisms, the function of the
cephalic furrow remains a mystery. Unlike other embryonic invaginations, such
as the ventral furrow or midgut invaginations, which are associated with
mesoderm and endoderm formation, the cephalic furrow does not give rise to any
precursor tissues or larval structures. It unfolds a couple of hours after
gastrulation without leaving morphological traces [@Vincent1997-fa]. Some of
the proposed roles for the cephalic furrow act as are temporary storage of
anterior surface cells until a later time in development [@Turner1977-ol], or
that it functions as an anchor to the anterior ventral cells making the germ
band only extend posteriorly [@Vincent1997-fa], or act as barrier to the tissue
flows and orienting the germ band extension towards the posterior during
gastrulation [@Dicko2017-wz]. But these hypotheses or the interactions of the
cephalic furrow with other morphogenetic movements have not been investigated
*in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac].

Our study investigates the role of the cephalic furrow by integrating
live-imaging of mutant embryos, *in vivo* mechanical perturbations, and *in
silico* simulations. 

# Ectopic folding in cephalic furrow mutants

<!--# Cephalic furrow mutants form ectopic folds-->

<!--Approach to uncover the function of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--We wondered if invaginating these cells is important for normal gastrulation.-->

The cephalic furrow retains hundreds of epithelial cells below the embryo’s
surface during gastrulation [@Stern2021-zv]. We asked whether the absence of a
cephalic furrow and the permanence of these epithelial cells on the surface has
any consequences to the embryo. Previous work revealed that in *eve* mutants,
where the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, a late irregular fold would
often form in the head region [@Vincent1997-fa]. Despite seemingly not being
formed through the cephalic furrow morphogenetic program [@Vincent1997-fa], the
origin of these late folds remained unclear. Only recently, it was revealed
that *btd* mutants also display late irregular folds [@Eritano2020-mi; see
Figure S5B], suggesting this phenotype might be a direct consequence of the
lack of the cephalic furrow in *btd* and *eve* mutants. To investigate the
developmental origins of these folds and the impact of the absence of the
cephalic furrow, we generated fluorescent *btd* and *eve* lines and imaged
mutant embryos *in toto* using lightsheet microscopy under high-temporal
resolution to capture the tissue dynamics of gastrulation.

<!--But the developmental processes driving formation of ectopic folds have remained obscure and led us to ask what was driving the formation of such fold. -->

<!--Ectopic folds were first described in *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa]. The authors observed that a late fold would frequently form near the cephalic furrow region *eve* embryos. Because it was irregular, variable in position, and only formed after the appearance of mitotic domains, they suggested that these late folds were not the result of the cephalic furrow program [@Vincent1997-fa]. In *btd* mutants, the presence of ectopic folds was only observed recently [@Eritano2020-mi; see Figure S5B]. Our analyses indicate that ectopic folds appear in *btd* and *eve* mutants because they lack a cephalic furrow.-->

Our live recordings of *btd* and *eve* mutants corroborate these previous
observations. We find that late epithelial folds appear on the head--trunk
interface of both mutants in a consistent matter ({@fig:ectopic}A,
{!@fig:vid-lateral-btd}, {!@fig:vid-lateral-eve}). We find that mutant embryos
can exhibit one to four epithelial folds on each side (*btd*=2.3±0.9 n=12,
*eve*=1.8±0.7 n=9, see Table S1) while sibling controls (heterozygote embryos
for *btd* or *eve*) invariably show a single invagination. Compared to the
cephalic furrow which stays folded for about two hours, these ectopic folds
quickly disappear from surface within 20 min ({@fig:ectopic}C). Their position
varies between individual mutant embryos. They form either anterior or
posterior to the head--trunk boundary ({@fig:ectopic}D,
{!@fig:vid-dynamics-btd} and {!@fig:vid-variability-btd}). Differently than the
cephalic furrow which initiates as a straight line almost orthogonal to the
anteroposterior axis and progressively declines posteriorly, the ectopic folds
form already tilted and have no obvious trend in angle direction over time
({@fig:ectopic}E). While the cephalic furrow shows stereotypic cell
morphologies in the different regions of the fold [@Spencer2015-td]
({@fig:intro}B and {@fig:ectopic}B), ectopic folds lack wedge-shaped
initiators, and have a wider and often asymmetric cleft ({@fig:ectopic}B,
{!@fig:vid-profile-btd} and {!@fig:vid-profile-eve}). In addition, ectopic
folds are nearly 25% shorter, and contain about half of the epithelial area
invaginated in the cephalic furrow of sibling controls ({@fig:ectopic}G,H).
Overall, these analyses reveal the formation of ectopic folds differs
significantly from that of the cephalic furrow, suggesting that different
morphogenetic mechanisms are involved in their formation.

<!--The fact that both mutants lacking a cephalic furrow formed late ectopic folds led us to ask whether these events are causally linked, and which morphogenetic processes drive ectopic fold formation.-->

<!--Because both mutants exhibit such intriguing ectopic folds, we wondered if their formation could be causally linked to the absence of the cephalic furrow. A late head fold was previously described in *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa], but the processes that drive the formation of these ectopic folds has not been studied. Therefore, to understand the origin of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants, we analyzed their morphology and dynamics throughout development.-->

# Increased tissue strain rate associated with mitotic domain formation and germ band extension

<!--Location and timing of ectopic folding correlates with mitotic domains-->

<!--MD1--MD5/MD9, MD5--MD7, MD7--MD6, and MD6--trunk-->

<!--The dividing cells lose their basal attachment, round up at the apical side, and more than double their apical area during during anaphase elongation ({@fig:cell-area-post-mitosis}). -->

The formation of ectopic folds occurs during the rapid phase of the germ band
elongation [@Campos-Ortega1985-ma] with around 40% egg length extension, and
coincides with the appearance of mitotic domains---groups of blastoderm cells
that divide in synchrony in cleavage cycle 14 [@Foe1989-cw]
({@fig:ectopic}A,C). Ectopic folds appear in variable positions along the
anteroposterior axis, but always in between or adjacent to mitotic domains
({@fig:mitogerm}A). Dividing cells expand their apical area during anaphase
elongation and compress adjacent non-dividing cells ({@fig:mitogerm}B). The
compressed region is the first to buckle inwards, followed by a portion of the
dividing cells within mitotic domains ({@fig:mitogerm}B). The mitotic expansions
always precede the formation of ectopic folds ({@fig:mitogerm}C), suggesting
they may be inducing the epithelium to buckle. Indeed, ectopic folds buckle
abruptly ({@fig:initiator}B, {!@fig:vid-mitotic-fold}).

To evaluate if *btd* mutants show increased tissue strain, we estimated the
strain rate using a particle velocity approach [@Blanchard]. At the head--trunk
region of sibling controls, the cephalic furrow appears before the gradual
increase in the tissue strain rate. In contrast, the appearance of ectopic
folds in *btd* mutants coincides with the peak strain rate in the tissue
({@fig:mitogerm}d, {!@fig:vid-strain-analysis}). The peak strain rate in *btd*
mutants is 1.3x higher than in sibling controls and coincides with the maximum
expansion of mitotic domains, suggesting the mutant tissues are under increased
compressive stress.

We noticed that ectopic folds could also form between MD6 and the tip of the
germ band. Dorsal epithelial cells between MD6 and the germ band are indeed
more compressed in some *btd* mutants compared to sibling controls
({@fig:mitogerm}e, {!@fig:vid-trunk-germ}). We measured the strain rate at this
trunk--germ region and find that it is lower than at the head--trunk region but
that it steadily increases over time ({@fig:mitogerm}A). These analyses suggest
that both the formation of mitotic domains, and the elongation of the germ band
extension, are exerting mechanical stress leading to increased tissue strain
which may be involved in the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow
mutants.

<!--TODO: Make figure to show squeezed cells-->

<!--To understand how mechanical stresses relate to ectopic folding, we measured the magnitude of strain rate in two locations. At the head--trunk interface where the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds appear, and at the trunk--germ interface more posteriorly. The strain rate is higher where tissues are being displaced, such as invaginating and buckling cephalic furrow and ectopic folds, respectively ({@fig:strain}A, {!@fig:vid-strain-analysis}).-->

<!--At the head--trunk region, the peak strain of control embryos occurs when the cephalic furrow has already invaginated, around 10 min after gastrulation, while the peak strain of *btd* embryos occurs around 16 min after gastrulation, and coincides with the maximum expansion of mitotic domains and the formation of ectopic folds ({@fig:strain}A).-->

<!--In *btd* mutants, epithelial cells near the canonical cephalic furrow position undergo some degree of apical constriction ({@fig:initiator}A and {!@fig:vid-initiator}). This creates an indentation that resembles the early cephalic furrow ({@fig:initiator}B). This indentation, however, forms delayed and does not extend along the dorsoventral axis. In addition, the cells at the center of the indentation, in contrast to initiator cells, do not shorten along the apical-basal axis ({@fig:initiator}B). In *eve* mutants no apical constriction or indentation occurs ({@fig:initiator}A,B). This reveals that remnants of initiator cell behavior are present in *btd* mutants.-->

# Modelling tissue interactions in the head--trunk interface

<!--Model using particles connected by strings-->

To test this hypothesis and get further insights into the tissue mechanics of
the head--trunk boundary, we built a model of a monolayer confined inside a
rigid shell. We modified a previous model [@Trushko2020-gf] to capture the
physical interactions occurring between mitotic domains, ectopic folds, germ
band, and the cephalic furrow. Our model represents the monolayer epithelium of
*Drosophila* blastoderm using a series of particles connected by springs, with
a spring constant rigidity and a bending rigidity ({@fig:mitogerm}f). The
particles are equidistant along the anterior to the posterior pole of an
elliptical arc. The dimensions and shape of this ellipse matches the typical
dimensions of an embryo ({@fig:fly-dimensions}). The particles are surrounded
on one side by a rigid elliptical shell representing the vitelline envelope.
The extension of the germ band occurs by the placement of the posterior end of
the epithelium towards the anterior end. Mitotic domains are represented by
regions of compressed springs and positive intrinsic curvature which captures
the thickness mismatch between mitotic domains and non-dividing cells
({@fig:mitogerm}f).

The main control parameter of our model is the ratio $\kappa/\lambda R^2$ while
the germ band position ($g$) represents the progression of the development. We
performed a parameter sweep and observe a buckling transition in the phase
space of $\kappa/\lambda R^2$ and $g$ ({@fig:mutant}a). The phase diagram shows
that for high values of bending rigidity ($\kappa/\lambda
R^2>1.2\times{10}^{-4}$) neither mitotic domains nor the germ band are
sufficient to cause ectopic folds. For intermediate values ($\kappa/\lambda R^2
\sim1\times{10}^{-4}$), however, both mitotic domains and germ band extension
are required to form ectopic folds. Finally, we observe that for low values of
bending rigidity ($\kappa/\lambda R^2<8\times{10}^{-5}$), the mitotic domains
alone are sufficient to cause the formation of ectopic folds. The embryo could
fall in either of the latter two regimes. We thus performed *in vivo*
experiments to determine in which regime of the parameter space the embryonic
tissue falls.

# Concomitant formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension drive ectopic folding

<!--Bending rigidity modulates mitotic domains induced-buckling-->

<!--Mitotic expansions insufficient to induce buckling in vivo-->

To test if mitotic domains alone are sufficient to induce ectopic buckling *in
vivo*, we mechanically blocked the extension of the germ band in cephalic
furrow mutants. For that we cauterized a patch of dorsal tissue, attaching it
to the vitelline envelope, at the onset of gastrulation ({@fig:mutant}A). When
the germ band extension is blocked in *btd* and *eve* mutants, no ectopic folds
appear at the head--trunk interface ({@fig:mutant}B, {!@fig:vid-cautlat-eve},
{!@fig:vid-cautdor-eve}, {!@fig:vid-cautdor-btd}). Mitotic expansions compress
the neighboring non-dividing cells, but no buckling occurs ({@fig:mutant}B,C).
In general, the cauterized mutant embryos show less epithelial deformations
compared to non-cauterized mutant embryos ({@fig:mutant}D--F). These
experiments reveal that *in vivo*, the local stresses generated by the mitotic
expansions are insufficient to cause epithelial buckling at the head--trunk
interface.

<!--TODO: Include somewhere that non-dividing cells in the model are under stress-->

<!--Germ band extension insufficient to induce buckling in silico-->

Next, we asked whether germ band extension alone is enough to cause ectopic
folds. We performed simulations using the same sweep parameters but without
mitotic domains around the above rigidity values. We find that for most of the
parameter space, including the bending rigidity values obtained with the
cauterization experiments, no ectopic folds appear in the blastoderm
({@fig:mutant}A). Ectopic folds only occur when the bending rigidity is
low and the germ band is at maximum extension. These simulations predict that
the germ band extension alone is insufficient to induce ectopic folding.

<!--Germ band extension insufficient to induce buckling in vivo-->

To test this prediction *in vivo*, we generated double-mutant flies lacking
both the cephalic furrow and the mitotic domains by combining *btd* mutants
with a loss-of-function allele of *string* (*stg*), a phosphatase that
regulates cell divisions in cleavage cycle 14 [@Edgar1989-hv]. Regular *stg*
mutants have normal morphogenetic movements and cephalic furrow formation
[@Edgar1989-hv] ({@fig:stg}A,B, {@fig:vid-stg-lateral}, {@fig:vid-stg-dorsal}).
We find that, as predicted by our model, *btd*--*stg* double-mutant embryos
show no ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface ({@fig:mutant}B,C,
{@fig:vid-double-lateral} and {@fig:vid-double-dorsal}). This observation
corroborates the hypothesis that the germ band extension is insufficient to
induce ectopic epithelial buckling in cephalic furrow mutants, and that both
mitotic domains and germ band required to induce buckling.

<!--
- Neither MD nor GB are sufficient for ectopic folding
- But when concomitant, they invariably drive tissue buckling
- Global compressive stress from the early germ band extension
- Local stress and force imbalance from mitotic expansions 
- Plus convergent tissue flows and shear stress from gastrulation
- Without CF the extra tissue on the surface increases instability
- We suggest the underlying mechanism is buckling morphogenesis
-->

<!--Early head--trunk invagination prevents ectopic buckling in silico-->

<!--TODO: See how all of this can fit in

There are some aspects to explore.

1. Germ band pushes the cephalic furrow deeper (wildtype cauterization).
2. The prevention of ectopic folds depending on the relative timing between
   mitotic domains, cephalic furrow, germ band (prd mutants with partial
   invagination?).
3. The region of influence of the cephalic furrow invagination (laser
   ablations).
4. The position of the cephalic furrow (slp mutant) [for revision].
5. Priming potential of cephalic furrow (would a dent be enough, prd mutants
   can give light).

# Cephalic furrow prevents ectopic folding in normal development

Given that in normal development we rarely observe the formation of ectopic
folds, we considered the hypothesis that the cephalic furrow may act as a
mechanical buffer to the head--trunk interface accommodating the compressive
stresses generated by mitotic domains and the germ band elongation.

To explore the role of the cephalic furrow as a mechanical buffer, we asked
whether a programmed head--trunk invagination could prevent the formation of
ectopic folds *in silico*. We expect that an invagination provides a mechanical
sink directing all mechanical stresses and preventing the build up of stress in
the epithelium. We simulated the cephalic furrow as a region with a negative
spontaneous curvature. This led to a sharp fold in the embryo recapitulating
the cephalic furrow ({@fig:wildtype}A).

We then programmed the invagination to start before, during, and after the
formation of mitotic domains at different germ band extensions. We observe that
when the cephalic furrow is present, beginning before mitotic domains, there
are no ectopic folds forming in the final state of the simulation
({@fig:wildtype}B). This only happens when the cephalic furrow forms before the
mitotic domains at maximum germ band extension, and within a limited region of
the blastoderm.

Using laser ablations in vivo we determined that this region under tension
generated by the invaginating cephalic furrow to be 80 µm wide, or 40 µm
anterior and posterior of the initiator cells ({@fig:wildtype}F--H). These
analyses suggest the cephalic furrow indeed decreases the build up of
mechanical stress, and by doing so prevents the formation of ectopic folds and
epithelial instabilities an otherwise fated to buckle region of the embryo.

Our simulations also revealed the extension of the germ band influences the
depth of the cephalic furrow. We asked whether in normal development, the
extending germ band could also be pushing the cephalic furrow deeper. To test
this, we blocked the germ band extension by cauterization in wild type embryos
and measured the maximum depth of the cephalic furrow. We find the maximum
depth of the cephalic furrow in cauterized embryos is about 10% shallower than
non-cauterized embryos ({@fig:wildtype}A--D). These experiments suggest that in
normal development the active pull generated by the cephalic furrow is the main
driver of the invagination. The germ band extension accounts only for a mild
influence in the depth of the invagination.

<!--TODO: slp mutant shows that moving CF anteriorly diminishes its capacity to absorb mechanical stress and an ectopic dorsal fold appears.-->

<!--TODO: prd mutant shows that partially perturbing CF is enough to prime the position of folding.-->

<!--TODO: Include such sentence after laser ablations or keep it for the sloppy paper? The region under influence of the cephalic furrow is molecularly patterned. It is defined by the stripes of slp which delimit the outer edges of the invagination.-->

<!--We first determined the region being pulled by the cephalic furrow at the onset of gastrulation. We measured the recoil velocity of laser-ablated cell membranes anterior and posterior to the initiator cells, as a proxy for the current tension in the tissue ({@fig:wildtype}F). The recoil velocity increases with time and decreases with the distance from the initiator cells ({@fig:wildtype}G,H). The tension profiles is symmetric anterior and posterior to the cephalic furrow, and becomes negligible around 40 µm from the initiator cells ({@fig:wildtype}H). This indicates the region under active pull by the cephalic furrow is 80 µm wide.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow invaginates mostly autonomously in normal development-->

<!--Thus our model suggests there is a mechanical basis for the cephalic furrow invagination.-->

<!--The elongation force of dividing cells can add-up to the global compressive stress, or the shift in cell height and detachment of the basal side can lead to an imbalance in the epithelium, which under compression becomes unstable (latter is more likely).-->

<!--TODO: Insert prd phenotype here?-->

<!--an idea already suggested by classical morphological works of *Drosophila* embryogenesis [@Campos-Ortega1997-rd].-->

<!--Taken together, our analyses reveal that the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants is a direct consequence of the tissue that remains on the blastoderm surface. This excess of tissue increases the mechanical stress at the head--trunk boundary with the concomitant expansion of mitotic domains in the head collide with the compression of trunk tissues by the extension of the germ band. The cephalic furrow actively invaginates before mitotic domains and germ band extension. By anticipating and storing tissues away the cephalic furrow buffers these opposed interactions playing a mechanical role during gastrulation.-->

<!--Thus, we propose the cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--Some predictions that can be taken from the models: what is the minimum/maximum area that needs to be invaginated so that the germ band does not causes ectopic folds. It suggests how much of the mitotic expansion and extension are needed to create instability in an epithelial monolayer. Finally, it suggests that the germ band is also pushing the epithelium in vivo.-->

# Discussion

2. MD and GB concomitant are important

6. CF role in preventing instability

-->

<!--TODO: Move this to beginning of discussion?-->

<!--Our experiments reveal that neither the mitotic domains nor the germ band alone are sufficient to drive ectopic folding in cephalic furrow mutants. But when the two events happen concomitantly, they invariably drive tissue buckling at the head--trunk boundary. Our data suggest the buckling is associated with the mechanical stresses generated by the mitotic domains and germ band extension. While the germ band makes a global compressive stress, the mitotic domains make local stresses and possibly force imbalance in the epithelium due to the shortening of dividing cells. In addition, the events generate tissue flow and shear stress that converges at the head--trunk boundary. Without the cephalic furrow, these combined mechanical stresses increase, making the monolayer epithelium unstable, suggesting the underlying mechanism of ectopic folding is buckling morphogenesis. Therefore, cephalic furrow might have a mechanical function that counteracts and buffers these mechanical stresses at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--TODO: Move to beginning of results-->

<!--Ectopic folds were first described in *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa]. The authors observed that a late fold would frequently form near the cephalic furrow region *eve* embryos. Because it was irregular, variable in position, and only formed after the appearance of mitotic domains, they suggested that these late folds were not the result of the cephalic furrow program [@Vincent1997-fa]. In *btd* mutants, the presence of ectopic folds was only observed recently [@Eritano2020-mi; see Figure S5B]. Our analyses indicate that ectopic folds appear in *btd* and *eve* mutants because they lack a cephalic furrow.-->

<!--But the developmental processes driving formation of ectopic folds have remained obscure and led us to ask what was driving the formation of such fold. -->

<!--Ectopic folds in *btd* mutants are visible in an earlier SEM image [@Blankenship2001-tm; see Figure 8F].-->

<!--Our live-imaging and simulations corroborate an hypothesis raised by @Eritano2020-mi that germ band compression and mitoses could generate buckling instabilities. -->

<!--1. Lack of CF = instability-->

We show the compression from the germ band, and the expansion of mitotic
domains, generate mechanical instability in the head--trunk epithelium. The
large surface of cells remaining on the surface in cephalic furrow mutants
leads to an increase in the mechanical stress on the epithelium. We show the
concomitant local expansions by the formation of mitotic domains with the
global compression generated by the germ band, generate tissue instabilities at
the head--trunk boundary which leads to erratic epithelial buckling. Distinct
mechanisms make tissues fold. Epithelial folding often involves a combination
of intrinsic cellular and extrinsic tissue forces [@Denk-Lobnig2020-pr]. 

<!--3. MD and epithelial buckling-->

Cell divisions alter the local properties of epithelial monolayers generating
outward forces and local stresses [@Gupta2021-oo]. Previous observations
suggest that force imbalance between mitotic domains play a role in tissue
buckling [@Ko2020-wk]. Mitotic cell rounding have been shown to induce
epithelial invagination in the tracheal placode of *Drosophila*
[@Kondo2013-gy], as well as in murine intestine villi [@Freddo2016-et]. It is
unclear whether it is the mechanical stress exerted by dividing cells or the
force imbalance in the epithelium created by the basal detachment of mitotic
cells which is associated with the buckling. In both cases an intraepithelial
compressive force is required for the generation of an invagination during
mitotic rounding. Compressive forces from growth under confinement can cause
epithelial buckling [@Trushko2020].

<!--4. GB (compression) and epithelial buckling-->

External stresses such as compressive forces can generate mechanical
instability in the tissue and lead to the formation of epithelial folds
[@Nelson2016-gz; @Collinet2021-qa]. Our *in vivo* data and *in silico*
simulations suggest a similar situation occurs at the head--trunk boundary
epithelium. Without the compression from the germ band, as mimicked by
cauterized cephalic furrow mutants, the expansion of mitotic domains are
insufficient to cause buckling. Without the expansion of mitotic domains to
generate areas prone to buckling, the compression by the germ band is
insufficient to initiate a buckling event, which alleviate the stress on the
monolayer of epithelial cells. Formation of ectopic folds depend on the early
phase of germ band extension. The process driven by the posterior midgut
invagination, and not by the cell intercalation because *eve* mutants have no
cell intercalation and still form ectopic folds [@Collinet2015]. This shows the
ectopic folds are the result a long-range tissue interaction between head and
trunk driven by the simultaneous expansion of mitotic domains and the extension
of the germ band.

<!--2. MD and GB concomitant are important-->

<!--5. Head--trunk shear compressive zone-->

These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by
the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ
band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when
both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle. The
simultaneous expansion of mitotic domains in the head and the extension of the
germ band from the trunk generate a convergent zone of tissue interactions that
make the folding at the head--trunk interface inevitable without the presence
of the cephalic furrow. In the absence of the cephalic furrow, the head--trunk
boundary, due to the complex morphogenetic processes and tissue flows, is a
zone of instability with increased compression and shear stresses.

<!--TODO: GB minor role in pushing CF?-->

We propose the cephalic furrow in *Drosophila* acts as a buffer to the tissue
interactions at the head--trunk boundary. The genetic control defines the
position of folding, and the active cell mechanisms anticipates other
gastrulation movements and primes the position of folding, generating a single
predictable fold that directs and stores temporarily the convergent tissue
flows from the head and from the trunk. By anticipating the mechanical stress
in the monolayer epithelium, the cephalic furrow thus prevents mechanical
instability, and the potential downsides associated with erratic buckling, such
as disruptions in cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling. It has a
physical role that counteracts the tissue-wide stresses generated by the
mitotic domains and germ band extension during gastrulation.

The evolution of the cephalic furrow in diptera might have been canalized into
development resulting in decreased tissue stress and instability for tissue
flows during gastrulation. Further comparative work in insect development may
reveal the evolutionary context for the evolution of the cephalic furrow. The
putative role of the cephalic furrow as buffer raises the hypothesis that it
evolved to solve a mechanical problem in the embryo, the fact that head and
trunk tissues inevitably collide due to the evolution of the germ band
extension. How mechanical interactions between embryonic tissues and between
tissues and their shell may have influenced the evolution of embryonic
development remains an unexplored subject. Therefore, our data reveals a case
suggesting that mechanical forces in the embryo might be drivers for
morphological evolution and might explain some of the diversity of shapes and
forms in early embryos inside shells which are not subject to external natural
selection. 

<!--Our simulations also revealed the buckling events are influenced by the roundness of the vitelline envelope. Buckling occurs more easily on straighter shells. This might explain why buckling at the tips is less frequent. Friction plays a role in the shape of the fold [Trushko]. Recent works show how interactions of the embryonic tissues with the shell [@Munster;@Bailles] and between gastrulation movements [@Guo2021] are important to embryonic development. Insect eggs have an outstanding diversity [@Church]. This observation might have implications to how egg shape might have influenced the evolution of development. And reveal a glimpse of the complex mechanical underpinnings of gastrulation dynamics around the head--trunk boundary of bilaterians.-->

<!--Global interactions between morphogenetic movements-->

<!--The mechanical interactions during gastrulation seem to make the folding at the head--trunk interface inevitable. This might partly explain why so few cephalic furrow mutants have been identified. Because even though the cephalic furrow is disrupted, it will still fold, though more irregular. Our data on prd and gt embryos supports that because the phenotype which is described as a late fold in fact is a disrupted cephalic furrow that only buckles with the appearance of mitotic domains. -->

<!--The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.-->

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process. That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process caused by the germ band was not.-->

<!--Why is that mitotic domains occur in patches rather than synchronized as the previous cycles? One possibility is that mitotic domains can interfere with with morphogenetic movements. Therefore, it would not work if all cells would divide at the same time while the tissue tries to fold and invaginate. Breaking up the mitotic divisions in limited patches is probably good for simultaneous. Since the head has almost no movements, there are a lot of domains there. -->

<!--Overall, our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.-->

<!--Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila. The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.-->

# Methods

## Fly genetics

We generated fluorescent cephalic furrow mutant strains by genetic crossing. We
mated flies carrying the loss-of-function alleles *btd^XA^* (FlyBase:
[FBal0030657](https://flybase.org/reports/FBal0030657), BDSC:
[#26815](https://bdsc.indiana.edu/Home/Search?presearch=26815)) and *eve^3^*
(FlyBase: [FBal0003885](https://flybase.org/reports/FBal0003885), BDSC
[#299](https://bdsc.indiana.edu/Home/Search?presearch=299)), with flies
carrying the fluorescent membrane marker GAP43-mCherry [@Martin2010-pb, gift
from Kassiani Skouloudaki]. The mutant alleles were balanced over the
fluorescent balancers FM7c-KrGFP (BDSC:
[#5193](https://bdsc.indiana.edu/Home/Search?presearch=5193)) and CyO-twiGFP
(gift from Akanksha Jain). We imaged the progeny of the established stable
lines *btd^XA^/FM7c-KrGFP;;GAP43-mCherry/MKRS;* and
*;eve^3^/CyO-twiGFP;GAP43-mCherry/MKRS;*, and used the lack of GFP signal to
distinguish homozygous embryos.

<!--TODO: Add prd and stg alleles.-->

<!--TODO: Add Gap,stg recombination.-->

<!--TODO: Add TM3-KrGFP balancer.-->

## Live-imaging

We collected embryos on apple juice agar plates at 25°C and immersed in 20%
sodium hypochlorite solution (Merck 1.05614.2500) for 1.5 min to remove the
chorion. We oriented the embryos on an agar pad and attached them to a
coverslip previously covered with a thin layer of heptane glue. Using silicone
glue we attached the coverslip to a sample holder and mounted the samples in a
Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1 microscope. For imaging lateral views, we used a Zeiss
20x/1NA Plan-Apochromat Water objective and acquired z-stacks of 0.X pixel size
and 3µm z-step covering one side of the embryo. For imaging dorsal views, we
used a Zeiss 40x/?NA Plan-Apochromat Water objective acquiring z-stacks of 0.X
pixel size and 1.5--3µm z-step covering the middle section of the embryo. The
time resolution was adjusted according to the number of embryos on the
coverslip, ranging between 45--60s. We acquired two channels simultaneously
using 488 and 561nm lasers, and an image splitter cube containing a LP560
dichromatic mirror and a LP585 emission filter. All recordings were performed
at 25°C.

<!--TODO: Add multiview description?-->

## Cauterization experiments

Embryos were collected and dechorionated as described above. Movies were
obtained in a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal spinning disk, an EMCCD camera (Andor
iXon DU-888), a 60× 1.2 NA water immersion objective, and the software AndorIQ
for image acquisition. The time resolution was set in 200 ms and pixel size was
0.180556 um. Embryos were mounted laterally on MatTek glass-bottom Petri dishes
and covered in water. Experiments were performed under temperature control at
28 degrees Celsius. For laser ablations, a Titanium Sapphire Chameleon Ultra II
(Coherent) laser at 800 nm was tuned down from 80 MHz to 20 kHz using a
pulse-picker. Laser power measured before microscope port was 6 mW and pixel
dwell time for scanning was 2 us. Each scan was repeated 10 consecutive times
to make a cut along a single cell. Embryos were ablated just once each. For
analysis, kymographs were obtained using the Fiji plugin Multi_Kymograph
(https://github.com/fiji/Multi_Kymograph) on cell edges in the direction
perpendicular to the cuts. The kymographs were binarized and distance between
edges versus time was linearly fitted to obtain the recoil velocity. 

## Image processing and analyses

We converted the raw microscopy datasets into individual TIFF stacks for
downstream processing using a custom ImageJ macro in Fiji [@Schindelin2012-di;
@Rueden2017-ky]. We generated 3D renderings of the lateral surface of the
embryos using the ImageJ/Fiji plugin 3Dscript [@Schmid2019-bm]. We improved the
signal-to-noise ratio and restored the z-resolution of lateral datasets from
3µm to 1µm by training a deep learning upsampling model using CARE
[@Weigert2018-ti]. We generated cartographic projections by segmenting the
surface of the embryo with ilastik [@Berg2019-ab] and using the ImSAnE toolbox
[@Heemskerk2015-kv]. We manually traced the fold outlines and areas of lateral
3D renderings and lateral cartographic projections, respectively, using Fiji.
We used the ImageJ Temporal-Color Code script with the mpl-viridis colorscheme
to visualize the fold dynamics. To segment membranes and quantify apical cell
areas we used MorphoLibJ plugin in ImageJ [@Legland2016-cp]. To analyze the
tortuosity of the epithelium we straightened the vitelline envelope using the
Straighten tool in ImageJ, and applied gaussian blur and thresholding to
extract the outline of the epithelium in dorsal views. We used custom Python
and R scripts to generate plots, and Inkscape to assemble the figure plates and
illustrations.
