# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila melanogaster* during gastrulation. Despite being a
prominent trait, the mechanisms and forces controlling the formation of the
cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we investigate the morphogenesis and
developmental role of the cephalic furrow in the global context of
gastrulation, by analyzing mutant embryos which fail to initiate the cephalic
furrow under live-imaging. We find that embryos lacking a cephalic furrow form
instead late ectopic folds in variable positions at the head--trunk interface.
We show the formation of ectopic folds is the result of the concomitant
expansion of head tissues, caused by mitotic domains, with the compression of
trunk tissues, caused by the germ band elongation. We propose the cephalic
furrow act as a buffer to these opposing tissue interactions during
gastrulation by priming the position of folding at the head--trunk boundary.

<!--The cephalic furrow background-->

The cephalic furrow is a prominent morphogenetic movement of *Drosophila*
gastrulation. It is a deep invagination that appear as lateral indentations at
the onset of gastrulation, and covers from dorsal to ventral, subdividing the
yolk from head and trunk [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw]. Unlike the ventral
furrow, however, the cephalic furrow is a transient structure that unfolds
after a couple of hours, and the invaginated tissue is not associated with a
particular fate in the embryo. This prominent but ephemeral nature makes the
cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic traits of gastrulation, both in terms
of the processes controlling its formation and its physical developmental role.

<!--The morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow-->

The morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is poorly understood
[@Gilmour2017-um]. The cephalic furrow begins with a single row of initiator
cells that sink into the yolk. The process occurs through a coordinated series
of cell shape changes and tissue movements, beginning with the shortening of
initiator cells and basal expansion, and a second step which develops into a
progressive invagination [@Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi]. This process
differs from other movements and remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um;
@Vincent1997-fa], but is highly stereotypic. The cephalic furrow is positioned
with 1% precision [@Liu2013-lc], a patterning that could be achieved with only
four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf], suggesting there is precise genetic patterning
coordinating the cephalic furrow formation in space and time.

<!--Cephalic furrow mechanics-->

The physical role that the deep invagination of the cephalic furrow play in the
complex morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation remain elusive.
Modeling simulations have suggested the cephalic furrow can act as an anchor to
the tissue [@Allena2012-pb]. Others have speculated that the cephalic furrow
might balance the germ band extension [@PhysicalHypotheses]. However, the
interactions of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not
been investigated [@Kong2017-ac], and its role in the global context of
gastrulation and the interplay between patterning and morphogenesis remain
open.

<!--This study-->

To investigate the developmental roles of the cephalic furrow morphogenesis to
Drosophila gastrulation, we analyzed effects of disruptions in cephalic furrow
formation to other gastrulation movements using live-imaging and laser
cauterizations in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Summary of findings-->

<!--TODO: Summarize to single paragraph.-->

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to results).-->
We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow---not only *eve*
mutants but also *btd* mutants---invariably form late ectopic folds at the
head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ in timing, formation
dynamics, folded area, and morphology to the cephalic furrow, suggesting they
are indeed formed by different processes. The position and timing of folding
events varies between individual mutant embryos, but correlates with the
position of mitotic domains, and the epithelium often buckles abruptly between
the dividing cells with expanded apical areas, suggesting that local tissue
forces might cause the tissue to buckle.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to results).-->
To tested whether the local tissue forces driven by mitotic domains are causing
the ectopic folds, we analyzed double mutant embryos for stg btd and stg eve
which form neither the cephalic furrow nor the mitotic domains in cycle 14. We
find that ectopic folds are still formed in stg btd and stg eve double mutants,
suggesting that mitotic domains might influence the position, or facilitate the
folding, but are not required, suggesting that other tissue forces might be the
driving force for ectopic folds.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to results).-->
Next we asked whether the compression of tissues caused by the elongating germ
band could be driving ectopic fold formation. We tested this hypothesis by
blocking the germ band extension by cauterizing the posterodorsal region in
mutant embryos. We find the ectopic folds are absent when the germ band is
mechanically blocked by the cauterization, suggesting that the global tissue
compression caused by the germ band extension is the main force contributing to
the formation of ectopic folds.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to results).-->
Given the unexpected finding that the germ band influences head tissues, we
then tested whether the germ band extension and its resulting tissue
compression also contributes to the normal process of cephalic furrow
formation. We find that cauterized wild type embryos have a shallower cephalic
furrow, indicating that the tissue compression from the germ band extension
affects the amount of invaginated cephalic furrow tissue.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to discussion).-->
Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation where the extension
of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk interface. This
interaction under normal embryogenesis pushes the cephalic furrow invagination
deeper in the yolk, providing a previously unknown physical component to the
cephalic furrow morphogenesis initiated independently by genetic means. Thus
revealing a global interaction between morphogenetic movements in Drosophila
gastrulation.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to discussion).-->
Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary,
to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic
furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow
accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ
band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable
invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus
preventing erratic epithelial buckling.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to discussion).-->
Overall, overall our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a
two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process
of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band
extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to
orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.

# Results

## Cephalic furrow mutants form ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary

<!--Study mutants to reveal CF function-->
To understand the role of the cephalic furrow in *Drosophila* development, we
studied mutant embryos where the cephalic furrow formation is perturbed. The
main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead*
(*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve*
embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination
[@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is
delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or
delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the
head--trunk boundary, and the global dynamics of gastrulation. We thus analyzed
*btd*, *eve*, and *prd* embryos with high temporal- and spatial-resolution *in
toto* lightsheet microscopy.
<!--Analyze local and global consequences for the lack of CF-->

<!--A late fold in the cephalic furrow region was described *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Our data extends this observation to *btd* embryos. We analyzed mutants to understand what is causing the formation of this folds, a reminiscent activity from the cephalic furrow patterning or a consequence of mechanical forces during gastrulation. However, the origin of such ectopic folds, either genetic as reminiscent of the cephalic furrow patterning, or simply mechanical remained unknown.-->

<!--Late ectopic folds form in CF mutants-->
We find that *btd* and *eve* embryos, which lack a cephalic furrow, form late
ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface (Figure @fig:ectopic-folding). The
ectopic folds differ from the normal cephalic furrow in many aspects. They form
at a considerable later stage. While the cephalic furrow forms on stage 6, at
the onset of gastrulation of wild type embryos, the ectopic folds appear
between late stage 7 and early stage 8, when the germ band has reached ~30% of
embryo length (Figure {@fig:ectopic-folding}A, Video 1 and 2).

<!--Morphology of ectopic folds differ from CF invagination-->
The ectopic folds show deviant morphology with the folded tissue being often
asymmetric with a wider cleft between edges, and lacking the typical cell shape
organization of the cephalic furrow (Figure {@fig:ectopic-folding}B).

<!--wedge shape at the invagination tip, the orthogonal position of middle cells, and the elongated morphology at the leading edges are absent-->

<!--The dynamics of ectopic fold formation also differs from the cephalic furrow invagination. -->

We traced the dynamics of ectopic fold formation on the blastoderm. The
cephalic furrow initiates as a straight dorsoventral line which progressively
bends into a curved line, while its dorsal portion shifts to the posterior end
and its ventral portion shifts to the anterior end (Figure
{@fig:ectopic-variability}A). In contrast the ectopic folds are mostly straight
through time (Figure {@fig:ectopic-variability}B,C).

<!--Ectopic folding area and depth smaller than CF invagination-->

We measured the area of folded tissue and the depth of ectopic folds (Figure
{@fig:ectopic-variability}D--F). The total area of folded tissue is roughly
half of a regular wild type cephalic furrow (Figure
{@fig:ectopic-variability}G). Similarly, we find that the depth of ectopic
folds is about half of the cephalic furrow invagination (Figure
{@fig:ectopic-variability}H). We observe that individual mutant embryos can
have the same total invaginated area either having one deep fold or two
shallower folds.

<!--Concluding differentness of ectopic folds-->

Overall these analyses suggest that ectopic folds have different properties
compared to the cephalic furrow and their formation is driven by different
developmental mechanisms acting in the embryo.

<!--TODO: Analyses of tissue flow in the absence of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--We analyzed the tissue flow in cephalic furrow mutants using particle image velocimetry. We find that without the cephalic furrow the head--trunk boundary region remains static against the movement of the trunk tissues.-->

## Position of ectopic folds is variable but coincides with mitotic domains

<!--Ectopic folds vary between individual mutant embryos-->

To understand the origin of ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants, we
analyzed how the folding events vary among mutants and individual embryos. We
find the formation of ectopic folds is variable between individual embryos,
either in *btd* or in *eve* mutants. The folds are distributed in diverse
positions along the head--trunk interface (Figure {@fig:ectopic-variability}I).
In both mutants the ectopic folds can occur near the canonical cephalic furrow
region, but also in more anterior or more posterior positions. The formation of
ectopic folds can even differ between the left and right side of the same
embryo (Figure {@fig:ectopic-variability}J). This variability is in stark
contrast to the stereotypic formation of the cephalic furrow in wild type
embryogenesis (Figure {@fig:ectopic-variability}I), suggesting the process of
ectopic fold formation is driven by stochastic events and mechanical forces in
the epithelial tissue.

<!--Ectopic folds appear between mitotic domains-->

To uncover what controls the position and formation of ectopic folds, we
analyzed how their formation correlates with the tissue dynamics at the
head--trunk boundary. We identified a correlation between ectopic folds and
mitotic domains (MD). In most cases, the ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve*
mutants often occur between adjacent mitotic domains (Figure
@fig:mitotic-domains). The most common position is near the canonical cephalic
furrow position. In btd embryos which lack MD2 [@CiteMD2btd], this ectopic fold
forms between MD5 and MD7, while in eve embryos which have an expanded MD2
[@CiteMD2eve], an ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD2. Other positions are
more anterior between MD1 and MD9/MD5, a less common and shallower fold between
MD7 and MD6, and the most posterior ectopic fold which forms posterior to MD6
(Figure {@fig:mitotic-domains}A--C). Thus ectopic folds occur adjacent to
mitotic domains.

<!--Ectopic folding coincides with area expansion of dividing cells-->

The analysis of the apical area of cells at the head--trunk interface revealed
the infolding of epithelial cells is preceded by the compression of cell apices
by the expansion of dividing cells in mitotic domains (Figure
{@fig:mitotic-domains}D). The apical area of epithelial cells about to fold
inwards diminishes at the same time that the apical area of dividing cells
increase. The only exception occurs in *btd* where we identified a reminiscent
initiator cell behavior with a narrow row of cells contracting their apices at
the canonical cephalic furrow position before the mitotic domains (Figure S).
However, in this case the tissue still only folds when the cells in adjacent
mitotic domains undergo area expansion during mitosis. 

<!--Ectopic folds form by tissue buckling rather than invagination-->

The dynamics of ectopic fold formation differs from the cephalic furrow
invagination. While the cephalic furrow forms by a progressive invagination,
the ectopic folds form by abrupt buckling of the tissue (Figure
{@fig:mitotic-domains}E). The epithelium simply buckles when compressed by
adjacent dividing cells. Therefore, even though the end result of ectopic folds
might appear similar to the cephalic furrow, the dynamics and formation process
are rather different.

<!--Concluding mitotic coincidence and buckling-->

Thus the fact that ectopic fold formation coincides in position and timing with
the expansion in the area of dividing cells during mitosis, suggests that local
tissue mechanical forces might be at play and causing the tissue to buckle.

## Ectopic fold formation is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by the germ band extension

<!--## Concomitant expansion of head tissues by the mitotic domains and compression of trunk tissues by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--Double mutants without mitotic domains and cephalic furrow-->

To test whether the local tissue forces generated by the mitotic domains indeed
cause the formation of ectopic folds, we generated embryos that form neither
the cephalic furrow nor the mitotic domains. We used the loss of function
allele of *stg*, a gene that regulates the mitotic domains in the nuclear cycle
14 [@CiteString], with the loss of function alleles for *btd* and for *eve*.

<!--Outcome where the tissue still buckles in double mutants-->

[Hypothetical outcome] In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants,
the ectopic folds are still present, suggesting that mitotic domains might
facilitate the position of folding, but are not required for their formation.
This indicates that other mechanical forces acting during gastrulation might be
the driving force of ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface.

<!--In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants, the ectopic folds are absent, suggesting the presence of mitotic domains is necessary for the formation of ectopic folds. This indicates they play a key role in the balance of local forces that lead to the formation of ectopic folds. -->

<!--Cauterization experiment to test germ band influence-->

We tested whether the germ band extension could be the driving force generating
ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary in cephalic furrow mutants. Evidence
for this came from the observation of ectopic folds forming posterior to the
MD6 which often showed compressed epithelial cells in the dorsal region (Figure
S). We tested this hypothesis by physically blocking the germ band from
extending in *btd* and *eve* mutants using laser cauterizations (Figure
@fig:germband-cauterizations).

<!--Blocking the germ band extension suppresses ectopic folds-->

Indeed, we found that when the germ band is mechanically blocked by the
cauterization, the tissue at the head--trunk boundary show no ectopic folds and
the epithelium is less irregular compared to the mutant embryos without
cauterization (Figure {@fig:germband-cauterizations}A,D,E). The mitotic domains
are still present and its dividing cells still cause a large expansion in the
area of the head tissues (Figure {@fig:germband-cauterizations}A). The apical
area expansion of dividing cells compress the non-dividing cells between
mitotic domains, but the compression is insufficient to cause the tissue to
buckle in cauterized mutant embryos (Figure {@fig:germband-cauterizations}B,
Video X).

<!--TODO: Estimate the expansion of head tissues in cauterized embryo-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

These experiments show the main driving force for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants comes from the global compression of trunk
tissues by the elongating germ band. When mitotic domains are present, the
dividing cells increase the local tissue interactions creating areas prone to
buckling, which bias the formation of ectopic folds.

We developed a 1D linear model to better understand the interplay of local and
global tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. The model corroborates
the idea that tissue compression from the germ band extension can trigger the
head tissues to buckle, given certain epithelial properties such as
cell-to-cell adhesion and rigidity remain constant (Figure
{@fig:germband-cauterizations}G).

## Mitotic domains and germ band plays a minor role in cephalic furrow formation during normal embryogenesis

the unexpected finding that the germ band influences head tissues, we
then tested whether the germ band extension and its resulting tissue
compression also contributes to the normal process of cephalic furrow
formation. We find that cauterized wild type embryos have a shallower cephalic
furrow, indicating that the tissue compression from the germ band extension
affects the amount of invaginated cephalic furrow tissue.

The dynamics of CF formation is largely influenced by other gastrulation events
such as the mitotic domains and the germ band extension (trace CF in cauterized
embryos, the furrow should be shifted posteriorly, and in stg mutants probably
more anterior).

Next, we asked whether the germ band elongation could be contributing to the
invagination of the cephalic furrow by exerting forces on the epithelium in
wild type embryos (see He ventral furrow). To test this hypothesis, we blocked
the germ band elongation in wild type embryos by cauterization prior to
gastrulation.

We found that in embryos with a successful cauterization the cephalic furrow
invagination is about 10% shallower compared to control embryos
(@fig:germband-cauterizations). The cephalic furrow length and germ band
extension show a weak but significant correlation. This indicates the physical
force exerted by the germ band extension also contributes to the cephalic
furrow invagination in normal embryogenesis, suggesting the cephalic furrow
morphogenesis is governed by the orchestration of genetic patterning with
mechanical forces in the embryo.

# Discussion

## The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone prone to epithelial instability

The cephalic furrow has not been as studied as other morphogenetic movements in
Drosophila gastrulation. Only a few cephalic furrow mutants have been
identified and the mechanisms of patterning and morphogenesis remain
understudied to this day. Part of the reason is that the cephalic furrow is a
transient structure and to identify mutant phenotypes one has to image its
formation, since there are no known consequences of not forming the cephalic
furrow. Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be able to investigate the
cephalic furrow formation.

<!--Cephalic furrow cryptic mutants due to ectopic folding-->

Using live-imaging, we found that cephalic furrow mutants with a delayed furrow
in fact fail to form the invagination, but still form a ectopic fold at the
canonical cephalic furrow position. We describe this for gt and there are
likely other genes that might be affecting the cephalic furrow development, but
are cryptic because it requires live-imaging.

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is characterized by a
boundary of tissue movements. The forces involved are a relatively static head
tissues that undergo expansion due to mitotic domains, and an anterior and
ventral flow of trunk tissues driven by the germ band elongation.
The invaginated area analysis suggests some sort of compensation in the amount
of invaginated tissue. Suggesting that mechanical forces acting in the
monolayer epithelia, such as the expansion of dividing cells, or the
compression exerted by the germ band, might be causally connected to the tissue
buckling.

## Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by germ band elongation

This indicates the germ band extension is the driving force underlying the
ectopic epithelial folding, and that mitotic domains facilitate but are not
sufficient to cause the tissue to buckle. By cauterization experiments we show
the germ band extension causes epithelial compression at the head-trunk
boundary. While in strong phenotypes, embryos that fail to initiate the furrow,
the compression results in ectopic folds, in wild type embryos the compression
further deepens the furrow. This shows evidence of the long range global impact
the germ band extension exerts during gastrulation.

<!--Incorporate-->

Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation where the extension
of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk interface. This
interaction under normal embryogenesis pushes the cephalic furrow invagination
deeper in the yolk, providing a previously unknown physical component to the
cephalic furrow morphogenesis initiated independently by genetic means. Thus
revealing a global interaction between morphogenetic movements in Drosophila
gastrulation.

## Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position

Therefore, the role that the cephalic furrow appears to accomplish during
gastrulation is to anticipate these conflicts and prime, in a predictable
manner, the position that the tissue will fold. In doing so, the cephalic
furrow would prevent potential defects associated with erratic buckling, such
as the compromise of cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling in the
epithelia, and thus ensure a stereotypical balance of forces required for the
precise patterning of embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary,
to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic
furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow
accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ
band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable
invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus
preventing erratic epithelial buckling.

<!--## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes-->

The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement
initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 ¬µm wide, as
supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further
deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the
head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type
and mutants.

Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an
active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process.
That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are
identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the
process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process
caused by the germ band was not.

Overall, overall our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a
two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process
of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band
extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to
orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.

## Conclusions

Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions
involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in
Drosophila.

The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical
parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving
insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that
control morphogenesis.
