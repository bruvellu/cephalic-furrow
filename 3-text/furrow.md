# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep epithelial invagination that demarcates the
head--trunk boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. Unlike other
embryonic invaginations, the cephalic furrow is a transient structure that
vanishes without giving rise to any particular tissues. It thus remains unclear
what role this prominent embryonic landmark plays in the embryo. Here we
investigate whether the cephalic furrow plays a physical role in *Drosophila*
embryogenesis. Using live-imaging of mutant embryos we analyze how defects in
cephalic furrow formation impact the tissue interactions during gastrulation.
We find that without the cephalic furrow, the head--trunk interface becomes
deformed and forms erratic ectopic folds. We show these folds are the result
extrinsic forces driven by the formation of mitotic domains and the extension
of the germ band. Thus, in the absence of the cephalic furrow, the opposing
interactions between head and trunk tissues increase the mechanical stress in
the monolayer epithelia. We thus propose the cephalic furrow buffers these
physical interactions by priming the position of folding and storing epithelial
tissue out-of-plane, and thus prevents epithelial instability at the
head--trunk boundary during gastrulation.

# Background

The evolution of bilateral symmetry revolutionized animal diversity. A major
aspect of bilaterian success was the separation between anterior and posterior
body domains, which provided the grounds for the functional specialization of
sensory structures in the head and locomotory appendages in the trunk. The head
and trunk identities are specified early in embryonic development through a
remarkably conserved regulatory landscape [@Holland1988-ii; @McGinnis1992-qj;
@Simeone1992-ny], suggesting that the mechanisms establishing the head--trunk
distinction are ancient and crucial to understand the evolution of bilaterians
[@Bruce1998-ek].

The head--trunk boundary in the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* is
demarcated by an enigmatic invagination known as the cephalic furrow. It begins
as bilateral indentations in the anterior portion of the blastoderm as one of
the first morphogenetic movements in the embryo at the onset of gastrulation.
These indentations quickly invaginate deep into the yolk sac, forming a
prominent anatomical landmark that divides the procephalon (posterior head
region) from the germ band (trunk region) [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw].
The position of the cephalic furrow is specified with a remarkable 1% accuracy
of the embryo length [@Liu2013-lc] and depends on the zygotic expression of
*buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*) stripe 1 [@Vincent1997-fa]. The
overlap between *btd* and *eve* specifies a single row of initiator cells which
shorten apicobasally driven by lateral myosin contractility [@Eritano2020-mi].
These initiators cells sink below the basal lamina, and followed by the
surrounding tissues, infold deep into the yolk through a coordinated and
stereotypic morphogenetic sequence [@Spencer2015-td]. While the tissue
invaginates, the mechanical coupling between epithelial cells ensures the
precision of the fold [@Eritano2020-mi]. Even though the patterning and
morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow remains poorly understood
[@Gilmour2017-um], the available data shows that its formation is under precise
genetic control and that safeguarding mechanisms are in place to ensure the
accuracy of morphogenesis.

Despite such tight control, it is unclear what is the role of the cephalic
furrow in development. Unlike other embryonic invaginations such as the ventral
furrow or midgut invaginations which are associated with mesoderm and endoderm
formation, the cephalic furrow does not give rise to any particular tissue in
the embryo. Even more intriguingly, the cephalic furrow is ephemeral. It
progressively unfolds in a couple of hours after gastrulation without leaving
morphological traces [@Vincent1997-fa]. A variety of roles have been proposed
such as a mechanical separation of domains etc [@cfroles]. In silico models
suggest the cephalic furrow might act as a barrier to the tissue flows
generated by the germ band extension during gastrulation [@Dicko2017-wz].
However, the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other morphogenetic
movements have not been investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac], and the physical
role of the cephalic furrow remains unclear.

In this study we investigate whether the cephalic furrow has a mechanical role
during gastrulation by examining how the tissue interactions at the head--trunk
boundary are impacted by defects in cephalic furrow formation. We find that
cephalic furrow mutants show increased strain and ectopic buckling events in
the monolayer epithelia of the head--trunk interface. We show this epithelial
instability is the result of extrinsic forces and is caused by the coincident
expansion of mitotic domains in the head, and the extension of the germ band in
the trunk. Our data suggests the cephalic furrow role in normal development is
to buffer these conflicting interactions by priming the folding and storing
epithelial tissue out-of-plane, and thus preventing mechanical stress at the
head--trunk boundary.

<!--Its transient nature makes the cephalic furrow particularly challenging to investigate, and partly the reason why only a few mutants have been identified. -->

<!--Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--We used live-imaging and laser cauterizations in cephalic furrow mutants.-->

<!--Interestingly, in *eve* embryos where the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, a late fold appears in the cephalic region [@Vincent1997-fa]. The origin of this late fold is unclear whether it is a reminiscent of the cephalic furrow patterning or formed by other developmental mechanisms. Thus, the physical role in the global dynamics of *Drosophila* gastrulation remains poorly understood.-->

<!--This process remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Mutants for either *btd* or *eve* fail to initiate the cephalic furrow [@Vincent1997-fa]. -->

<!--a patterning that can be achieved with only four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf]-->

<!--The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead* (*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve* embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination [@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow is genetically-defined with a precise stereotypic timing and position. The invagination is large extending from dorsal to ventral and deep sinking almost the whole yolk invagination at an important anatomical landmark of the embryo, the head--trunk boundary. Yet, the cephalic furrow, unlike the ventral furrow, does not give rise to a particular cell fates and is transient, this massive structure progressively unfolds before germ band retraction. These features, being a major but transient structure make the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic morphogenetic movements in *Drosophila* gastrulation (@fig:headtrunk).-->

<!--Cephalic furrow directs convergent tissue flow preventing epithelial deformations at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ from the cephalic furrow in timing, formation dynamics, folded area, and morphology. The number and position of ectopic folds across the anteroposterior axis varies between individual mutant embryos. We show the timing and position of ectopic folds correlates with the formation of mitotic domains, suggesting that local tissue interactions are causing the tissue to buckle. These local interactions, however, are not sufficient to generate ectopic folds. Using laser cauterizations to mechanically block the germ band extension, we show the occurrence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary depends on the global tissue compression caused by the germ band extension, and that this interaction also contributes to the cephalic furrow formation in normal embryogenesis.-->

<!--Our analyses reveal the head--trunk boundary is a convergent zone of tissue interactions during gastrulation being orchestrated by two morphogenetic events, the mitotic domains causing the expansion of head tissues, and the germ band causing the compression of trunk tissues. Without the formation of the cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary will inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably. Thus, we propose the cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

# Results

The formation of the cephalic furrow is quick and highly-dynamic. Therefore, to
be able to capture the tissue interactions occurring at the head--trunk
boundary of cephalic furrow mutants, we generated flies containing
loss-of-function alleles in a fluorescent background, and imaged the embryos
*in toto* under high-temporal resolution using lightsheet microscopy.

<!--We generated flies containing loss-of-function alleles known to disrupt cephalic furrow formation [*btd^XA^* and *eve^3^*, @Vincent1997-fa] and a fluorescent membrane marker [GAP43-mCherry, @Martin2010-pb].-->

We first analyzed the epithelial dynamics in *btd* and *eve* mutants. These two
genes specify the row of initiator cells that drive the invagination of the
cephalic furrow, and when their function is disrupted, the cephalic furrow
fails to initiate and does not form [@Vincent1997-fa]. In embryos heterozygote
for the *btd* or *eve* loss-of-function alleles (i.e. sibling controls), the
cephalic furrow initiates at the onset of cellularization, invaginates for 15
min, and begins to unfold around 30 min after gastrulation ({@fig:ectopic}A).
In embryos homozygote for the *btd* or *eve* alleles (i.e. mutants), the
cephalic furrow fails to initiate and no invagination is visible in the lateral
surface of stages 6 and 7a ({@fig:ectopic}A). In the subsequent stages 7b and
8, however, we observe the formation of epithelial folds at the head--trunk
interface of both *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos ({@fig:ectopic}A, Video 1 and
2). These folds, from now on referred as ectopic folds, appear with the mitotic
domains, and reach their fullest extension in stage 8, but have an even shorter
existence than the cephalic furrow, folding and unfolding entirely in a span of
20 min ({@fig:ectopic}A). The presence of ectopic folds in both *btd* and *eve*
raised the possibility that this phenotype is associated with the absence of
the cephalic furrow in these embryos. We thus characterize the distribution and
dynamics of ectopic fold formation to understand the processes causing the
head--trunk tissue to fold in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--We manually traced individual folds and extracted tortuosity measurements, angle displacement, folded area, and location along the anteroposterior axis.-->

<!--TODO: Include tortuosity of dorsal views around here-->

We find that *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos invariably form between one and
four ectopic folds per embryo side (Table 1, {@fig:dynamics}A,D). The ectopic
folds lack the stereotypic cell morphologies present in the cephalic furrow,
such as wedge-shaped initiator cells, and have a wider and often asymmetric
cleft ({@fig:dynamics}A, Video 3 and 4). Ectopic folds form by an abrupt
epithelial buckling, instead of progressive invagination as it occurs with the
cephalic furrow ({@fig:dynamics}B), and the resulting fold is about 25% shorter
than the cephalic furrow of sibling controls ({@fig:dynamics}C). This shallower
depth is reflected in the total epithelial area contained within ectopic folds,
which is about half of the area contained within the cephalic furrow
invagination in sibling controls ({@fig:dynamics}H,I). Unlike the cephalic
furrow which forms within a confined region of the embryo, the distribution of
ectopic folds along the head--trunk interface varies between individual mutant
embryos ({@fig:dynamics}E). Finally, we also observe differences in the shape
dynamics between the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds. While the former shows
a progressive backwards tilt in its orientation which is accompanied by a
smooth bending of the fold outline during the first 15 min after gastrulation,
the latter forms already tilted and shows variable shapes with no particular
trend in time ({@fig:dynamics}F--I). Overall, these analyses reveal that
ectopic folds not only differ significantly from the cephalic furrow, but that
their formation is more variable than the formation of the cephalic furrow.
This suggests that ectopic folds are formed by distinct developmental
mechanisms, and that they might be driven by extrinsic mechanical forces acting
in the monolayer epithelia rather than by the genetic control.

<!--and it can even differ between the left and right side of the same embryo ({@fig:dynamics}H).-->

<!--We identified a difference between *btd* and *eve* embryos. While *eve* mutants show no initiator cell behavior, we observe cell shape changes in *btd* mutants that are reminiscent of initiator cell behaviors ({@fig:dynamics}B).-->

Despite being variable, the distribution of ectopic folds is not random. We
find a correlation between the position of ectopic folds at the head--trunk
interface with the position of mitotic domains---groups of blastoderm cells
that divide in synchrony during mitotic cycle 14 [@Foe1989-cw]. That is,
ectopic folds often form adjacent to or in between mitotic domains
({@fig:mitotic}B,C). We identify four distinct locations of ectopic folds,
either anterior or posterior to the canonical cephalic furrow position. In
*btd* embryos they can form between MD1 and MD9/MD5, between MD5 and MD7,
between MD7 and MD6, and posterior to MD6 ({@fig:mitotic}B). In *eve* embryos a
similar folding pattern is present except for the lack of ectopic folds between
MD7 and MD6. The formation of ectopic folds coincide, not only spatially, but
also temporally with mitotic domains. The expansion in apical area of dividing
cells, displaced apically in the epithelium, always precedes the formation of
ectopic folds and the buckling initiates in area of non-dividing epithelial
cells which undergo compression ({@fig:mitotic}B). When the tissue buckles, the
area of mitotic domains also partially fold inwards ({@fig:mitotic}B). Unlike
the cephalic furrow invagination, the buckling of ectopic folds occurs abruptly
with the expansion of mitotic domains (Video 6). These observations indicate
that local forces generated by the expansion of mitotic domains might induce
the formation of ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants.

<!--TODO: Include stress analysis by Marina-->

<!--The difference can be related to the fact that *btd* embryos lack MD2 [@Edgar1994-pi] while *eve* mutants have an expanded MD2 [@Vincent1997-fa].-->

To test whether the mitotic domains are required for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants, we generated __[double-mutant flies carrying
the loss of function alleles for *btd* or *eve* and a loss of function allele
for *stg*]__[^double], a gene that regulates the formation of mitotic domains
in cycle 14 [@Edgar1989-hv]. In this manner embryos homozygote to both *btd*
and *stg* alleles (or *eve* and *stg*) lack both the cephalic furrow and the
mitotic domains. __[The double-mutant embryos *still|do not* show ectopic
folds]__[^hypo] ({@fig:mitotic}C). Therefore, although mitotic domains might
bias the position of folding events along the epithelia, they are not the sole
drivers for the formation of ectopic folds and other extrinsic forces are
involved.

[^double]: Replace by the dsRNA experiments which might be ready sooner.
[^hypo]: This is a hypothetical result, the data is not ready yet.

<!--TODO: Insert comparison of flows-->

Our observations led us to consider the germ band as the putative driver for
the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants. When the germ band
extends the tissues from the head and from the trunk converge around the dorsal
region of the head--trunk boundary ({@fig:mitotic}D). The tissues within this
region are visibly more compressed in *btd* mutants, suggesting the germ band
extension might be exerting some mechanical force ({@fig:mitotic}E). To test if
the extension of the germ band is required for the formation of ectopic folds,
we mechanically block the germ band extension in *btd* and *eve* mutants by
cauterizing the epithelial tissue to the vitelline envelope at the onset of
gastrulation ({@fig:cauterization}A). Surprisingly, when the germ band
extension is blocked in mutant embryos, no ectopic folds appear in the
head--trunk epithelia ({@fig:cauterization}B, Video 7,8). Mitotic domains are
still present, and still compress non-dividing cells, but their expansion does
not lead to ectopic folds ({@fig:cauterization}B,C). The monolayer epithelium
of cauterized mutants shows significant narrower deformation ranges after
gastrulation when compared to non-cauterized mutants
({@fig:cauterization}D--F). These experiments reveal that the local forces
generated by the mitotic domains alone are insufficient to cause the tissue to
buckle, and that instead, the major driving force for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants is the compression of trunk tissues caused by
the elongating germ band[^conco]. 

[^conco]: There is the possibility that the germ band alone is not the main
driver and that both mitotic domains and germ band concomitantly are required
to induce the formation of ectopic folds. This will be the case if no ectopic
folds are observed in the double-mutants or stg RNAi experiments.

<!--TODO: Reinsert wildtype cauterizations here? Check suppl.md-->

Next we asked whether the germ band also had a mechanical push in wild type
embryos. We mechanically blocked the germ band and measured the depth of
invagination. We find that indeed, the cephalic furrow is 10% smaller in
cauterized embryos. However that most of the cephalic furrow invagination
occurs autonomously. Using laser ablations we estimated the area under the
active pull of the cephalic furrow to be 40 µm in each direction. The
invagination is mostly autonomous with a weak interaction with the germ band,
but that this interaction might be stronger when the cephalic furrow does not
invaginate and the epithelial tissue remains in plane.

<!--TODO: Reinsert prd phenotype here? Check suppl.md-->

<!--TODO: Continue from here-->

To understand the balance of forces acting in the embryo, we generated a 1D
line model to understand whether the strain caused by the mitotic expansion in
the monolayer epithelia could determine the position of folding events in the
epithelia. Using a X model and running Y simulations, we observe that mitotic
expansion can increase the probability of folding only when that expansion is
greater than 1.25x, and that the fold depth correlates with the expansion
dimension ({@fig:model}). We also observe that the folds occur at the edge of
the mitotic domains, reminiscent of what occurs *in vivo* ({@fig:mitotic}B),
and that when two mitotic domains are near each other, the probability of
folding occurring between them increases ({@fig:model}).

We then included in the simulation the cephalic furrow using a negative
intrinsic curvature parameter to understand how it impacts and scales with the
effects of the mitotic expansion. We observe the presence of the cephalic
furrow greatly decreases the probability of ectopic folds forming in the
surrounding regions, and the depth of folds generated by mitotic expansion.
This is specially true when we introduce a delay in the mitotic expansion as it
occurs in the embryo (mitotic domains only appear when the cephalic furrow is
half-invaginated), but the effects of a folding on adjacent fold probability
also occurs in folds generated by mitotic domains. These simulations provide a
basic model of how mitotic expansions and their interactions can lead to
ectopic fold formation in a epithelial monolayer and explain the distribution
pattern of folding events observed *in vivo*.

To test whether the germ band extension alone is sufficient to cause
deformations and ectopic buckling in the head region without the presence of
mitotic domains, we incorporated the findings above and the germ band extension
into our 1D in silico model. The simulations show the germ band extension only
generates ectopic folding when its extension rate is above X. This indicates
the in vivo the germ band extension alone without the presence of the cephalic
furrow would not generate ectopic folds (@fig:model).



# Discussion

<!--In *eve* mutants, however, a late fold forms near the cephalic furrow position [@Vincent1997-fa]. The formation of late folds has been depicted in *btd* embryos in later works [see Figure 8F in @Blankenship2001-tm; and Figure S5B in @Eritano2020-mi]. These folds do not seem to form via the cephalic furrow program, but their developmental origin and the processes underlying their formation has remained unanswered.-->

<!--Context and core cephalic furrow findings-->

The cephalic furrow remains as the least understood morphogenetic movement of
Drosophila gastrulation. Here we show that without the cephalic furrow, the
epithelial stability at the head--trunk boundary is compromised leading to the
formation of ectopic buckling events driven by extrinsic mechanical forces in
the tissue.

<!--Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be able to investigate the cephalic furrow formation.-->

Epithelial folding in development can occur through different mechanisms and
often involve a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic forces
[@Denk-Lobnig2020]. Example of how compressive tissue forces can generate
mechanical instability in the tissue [@Collinet2021]. We show there are at
least two key extrinsic forces involved in the formation of these ectopic
folds, the mitotic domain expansions and the germ band extension.

<!--The effects of mitotic events in epithelial stability-->

Mitotic domains alter epithelial stability and bias buckling positions.
Previous observations suggest that force imbalance between mitotic domains
[@Ko2020-wk] and forces generated by mitotic expansion [@Gupta2021-oo] can
influence adjacent tissue and play a role in tissue buckling. Mitotic rounding
can induce invagination [@Kondo2013-gy]. When mitotic domains are present, the
dividing cells generate areas prone to buckling, which bias the formation of
ectopic folds. Thus mitotic forces matter. However, the germ band extension is
what drives the formation of ectopic folds. Germ band compression drives the
tissue to buckle. This observations reveal an example of how the interplay of
different extrinsic mechanical forces can drive and result in epithelial
folding [@Denk-Lobnig2020].


<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

<!--The hidden interactions between morphogenetic movements-->

Our work reveals unexpected long-range tissue interaction between the germ band
nd the head--trunk boundary. Recent works show how interactions of the
embryonic tissues with the shell [@Munster;@Bailles] and between gastrulation
movements [@Guo2021] are important to development. However, the interactions of
the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not been
investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac]. Our work reveals the cephalic furrow
formation is mostly driven by intrinsic forces, but that extrinsic forces also
play a minor role suggesting a potential interaction between the germ band and
cephalic furrow. 

The mechanical interactions during gastrulation seem to make the folding at the
head--trunk interface inevitable. This might partly explain why so few cephalic
furrow mutants have been identified. Because even though the cephalic furrow is
disrupted, it will still fold, though more irregular. Our data on prd and gt
embryos supports that because the phenotype which is described as a late fold
in fact is a disrupted cephalic furrow that only buckles with the appearance of
mitotic domains. 

<!--The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.-->

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process. That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process caused by the germ band was not.-->

<!--The consensus between in silico and in vivo results-->

Our in vivo data is consistent with the observations that the head--trunk
boundary is a convergent zone of tissue flows during gastrulation and that the
cephalic furrow directs the tissue flows. The physical role of the cephalic
furrow has been investigated in silico. Numerical approaches suggest the
cephalic furrow might play a global role to the complex morphogenetic movements
of gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb; @Dicko2017-wz]. A similar flow has been
predicted numerically where the formation of the cephalic furrow would direct
the tissue flows of the entire embryo [@Dicko2017-wz].  One hypothesis is that
the cephalic furrow act as a barrier to the tissue flows and orients the germ
band extension towards the posterior [@Dicko2017-wz]. Instead of a barrier, we
propose it has a mechanical role as sink or storage of tissue that buffers or
alleviates the tissue-wide tension due to gastrulation movements.

<!--The proposed mechanical role for the cephalic furrow-->

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is a convergent zone of
tissue flow during gastrulation with increased tissue strain. In the absence of
the cephalic furrow, the tissue flows at the head--trunk boundary are
disrupted, and a significant epithelial area remains on the surface. Thus the
expansion caused by mitotic domains combined with the compression caused by the
germ band extension increases tissue strain at the head--trunk boundary. The
outcome is the formation of stochastic ectopic folds of mechanical origin.
These findings allow us to speculate on the putative developmental role of the
cephalic furrow for gastrulation.

Thus, what the cephalic furrow accomplishes during gastrulation is to
anticipate the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary by priming the
position of a predictable (and genetically-determined fold). The cephalic
furrow invagination stores epithelial cells out-of-plane in a stereotypic
manner. The convergent tissue interactions are directed and buffered by the
cephalic furrow invagination. The cephalic furrow thus have a mechanical role
counterbalancing the convergent mitotic domain and germ band movements. The
cephalic furrow thus prevents the epithelial instability in an area of
potential tissue interactions, and with that potential defects associated with
erratic buckling, such as the compromise of cell-to-cell interactions or
short-range signaling in the epithelia, and thus ensure a stereotypical balance
of forces required for the precise patterning of embryonic tissues during
gastrulation.

<!--Broader evolutionary overview-->

Our study analyzes the developmental role of the mysterious cephalic furrow in
*Drosophila*. We propose it accomplishes a mechanical role during gastrulation
buffering tissue interactions between head and trunk. It remains unclear,
however, what led to the evolution of cephalic furrow in the first place and
the traits associated with it. The putative role of the cephalic furrow as
buffer raises the hypothesis that it evolved to solve a mechanical problem in
the embryo, the fact that head and trunk tissues were coliding due to the
evolution of the germ band extension. Therefore, our data reveals a case
suggesting that mechanical forces in the embryo might be drivers for
morphological evolution and might explain some of the diversity of shapes and
forms in early embryos inside shells which are not subject to external natural
selection. Further comparative work in insect development is needed to clarify
the evolutionary context for the evolution of the cephalic furrow and reveal a
glimpse of the complex mechanical underpinnings of gastrulation dynamics around
the head--trunk boundary of bilaterians.

<!--Why is that mitotic domains occur in patches rather than synchronized as the previous cycles? One possibility is that mitotic domains can interfere with with morphogenetic movements. Therefore, it would not work if all cells would divide at the same time while the tissue tries to fold and invaginate. Breaking up the mitotic divisions in limited patches is probably good for simultaneous. Since the head has almost no movements, there are a lot of domains there. -->

<!--Overall, our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.-->

<!--Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila. The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.-->
