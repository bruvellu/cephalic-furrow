# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila melanogaster* during gastrulation. Despite being a
prominent trait, the mechanisms and forces controlling the formation of the
cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we investigate the developmental role of
the cephalic furrow in the global context of gastrulation by live imaging
mutant embryos under lightsheet microscopy. We find that embryos lacking a
cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds in variable positions at the
head--trunk interface. We show the formation of ectopic folds is the result of
the concomitant expansion generated by mitotic domains, with the compression
driven by the germ band elongation. We propose the cephalic furrow act as a
buffer to these opposing tissue interactions by priming the position of folding
at the head--trunk boundary early in gastrulation.

# Introduction

<!--The head--trunk boundary is an ancient and essential trait for the evolution of bilaterians.-->

<!--The cephalic furrow background-->

The cephalic furrow is a prominent epithelial invagination that forms at the
head--trunk boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. Together with the
ventral furrow, the cephalic furrow is one of the first morphogenetic movements
in the embryo [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw]. It begins as lateral
indentations which quickly extend to the dorsal and ventral sides, and
invaginate deep into the yolk sac. Unlike the ventral furrow, however, the
invaginated cells do not give rise to any particular tissue, and the cephalic
furrow unfolds after a couple of hours of gastrulation. This prominent but
ephemeral existence makes the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic traits
of gastrulation.

<!--This process differs from other movements [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa]. -->

<!--This process remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Cephalic furrow patterning and morphogenesis-->

The cephalic furrow formation is genetically determined. It is regulated by the
zygotic expression of *buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*). The
overlap between *btd* expression in the head and *eve* stripe 1 is required to
the specification of the initiator cells [@Vincent1997-fa]. This thin row of
initiator cells undergo a coordinated series of cell shape changes, beginning
with cell shortening and followed by basal expansion. These cells sink below
the epithelial basal lamina and the surrounding tissues progressively
invaginate into the yolk [@Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi]. The position of
the cephalic furrow specified with incredible precision of 1% the embryo length
[@Liu2013-lc], and a mechanical coupling between epithelial cells ensures the
precision of the fold [@Eritano2020-mi]. These findings highlight the precise
genetic patterning in place coordinating the stereotypic formation of the
cephalic furrow in space and time.

<!--a patterning that can be achieved with only four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf]-->

<!--The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead* (*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve* embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination [@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow physical role-->

Despite increasing understanding of how the cephalic furrow forms, it is less
clear what developmental role this deep invagination plays during gastrulation.
A tissue fold can put epithelial cells in close contact and initiate
cell-to-cell communication important for the patterning of blastoderm cells.
However, there is no evidence so far. Numerical approaches to understand the
global gastrulation dynamics suggest the cephalic furrow plays a global role to
the complex morphogenetic movements of gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb;
@Dicko2017-wz]. The cephalic furrow can act as a barrier to the tissue flows
and has a global effect in orienting the germ band extension towards the
posterior [@Dicko2017-wz]. However, the interactions of the cephalic furrow
with other gastrulation movements have not been investigated *in vivo*
[@Kong2017-ac], and its physical role remains in the global dynamics of
*Drosophila* gastrulation remains poorly understood.

<!--Approach of this study-->

To investigate this question, we analyzed how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary
global gastrulation dynamics using live-imaging and laser cauterizations in
cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Summary of findings-->

We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow form late
ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ in
timing, formation dynamics, folded area, and morphology to the cephalic furrow.
The number and position of ectopic folds across the anteroposterior axis varies
between individual mutant embryos. We show the timing and position of ectopic
folds correlates with the formation of mitotic domains, suggesting that local
tissue interactions are causing the tissue to buckle. These local interactions,
however, are not sufficient to generate ectopic folds. Using laser
cauterizations to mechanically block the germ band extension, we show the
occurrence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary depends on the global
tissue compression caused by the germ band extension, and that this interaction
also contributes to the cephalic furrow formation in normal embryogenesis.

Our analyses reveal the head--trunk boundary is a convergent zone of tissue
interactions during gastrulation being orchestrated by two unexpected
morphogenetic events, the mitotic domains causing the expansion of head
tissues, and the germ band causing the compression of trunk tissues. Without
the formation of the cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the
head--trunk boundary will inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle almost
unpredictably. Thus, we propose cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting
tissue interactions by priming the position of folding, generating a
predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia and buffering the
tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. Overall, contributes to our
understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the
intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.

# Results

## Cephalic furrow mutants form variable ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary

We studied cephalic furrow mutants to understand how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impact the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary during
gastrulation. We generated flies with a fluorescent background and
loss-of-function alleles for the cephalic furrow genes *buttonhead* (*btd*),
*even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*), and acquired *in toto* live
imaging data of mutant embryos using lightsheet microscopy.

<!--Late ectopic folds form in CF mutants-->

In *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos, the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate and
is entirely absent [@Vincent1997-fa]. However, an intriguing late fold was
observed in the cephalic region of *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa]. Our live
imaging data corroborate this observation in *eve* mutants, and reveals that
*btd* embryos also form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface during
gastrulation (@fig:ectopic).

<!--Motivation to analyze ectopic fold formation-->

To understand the origin of these ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants, we
analyzed how the pattern, dynamics, and variability of folding events compared
to the cephalic furrow formation. 

<!--Ectopic folds form late-->

We first detect ectopic folds late during gastrulation. While the cephalic
furrow in wild type embryos forms in stage 6, at the onset of gastrulation, the
ectopic folds in mutant embryos only appear in stage 8, when the germ band has
already extended at least a third of the embryo length ({@fig:ectopic}A, Video
1 and 2). Unlike the stereotypic morphology of the cephalic furrow, the ectopic
folds are often asymmetric, have a looser cleft between edges, and lack the
typical cell shapes at the invagination tip and edges ({@fig:ectopic}B). The
number of ectopic folds on each side of the embryo varies between one to four.
Mutant embryos without ectopic folds were rare.

<!--Dynamics are different-->

The dynamics of ectopic folding differs from the canonical cephalic furrow
formation. By tracing the position of the ectopic folds in the blastoderm
across time, we find the starting angle of ectopic folds is generally tilted in
relation to the cephalic furrow (TODO). The cephalic furrow initiates as a
straight dorsoventral line which progressively bends into a curved line, while
its dorsal portion shifts to the posterior end and its ventral portion shifts
to the anterior end ({@fig:variability}A). In contrast the ectopic folds are
mostly straight over time and do not extend as far dorsal or ventral as the
cephalic furrow ({@fig:variability}B,C).

<!--Ectopic folding area and depth smaller than CF invagination-->

To estimate the area of epithelial tissue folded inside ectopic folds, we
created a cartographic projection of the embryos by fitting its surface to a
cylinder and unwrapping the cylinder as a flat surface. We then tracked the
infolded cells backwards and demarcated the folded region on the blastoderm
before gastrulation ({@fig:variability}D--F). We find the total area of folded
tissue contained in the ectopic folds of *btd* and *eve* embryos is roughly
half that of cephalic furrow in sibling controls ({@fig:variability}G). We also
measured the depth of the ectopic folds and found a similar result
({@fig:variability}H).

<!--Ectopic folds vary between individual mutant embryos-->

We noticed that individual mutant embryos not only have different numbers of
ectopic folds, but that the position of these folds in the blastoderm vary from
embryo to embryo. We compiled the tracing data normalized by embryo length to
understand the distribution of ectopic folds along the head--trunk interface.
The data reveals the position of ectopic folds vary greatly compared to the
position of the cephalic furrow formation on the lateral blastoderm
({@fig:variability}I). The ectopic folds, either in *btd* or in *eve* mutants,
can occur near the canonical cephalic furrow region, but also occur in more
anterior or more posterior positions. The formation of ectopic folds can even
differ between the left and right side of the same embryo
({@fig:variability}J). This variability is in stark contrast to the stereotypic
formation of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis, suggesting the
process of ectopic fold formation might be driven by stochastic events and
mechanical forces in the epithelial tissue.

<!--TODO: We observe that individual mutant embryos can have the same total invaginated area either having one deep fold or two shallower folds.-->

<!--Sidenote for paired-->

In addition, we analyzed *prd* embryos where the formation of the cephalic
furrow is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. Although *prd* embryos seem to form a
cephalic furrow at the expected position, our live imaging reveals the process
of invagination initiates but halts mid way through (Figure X). Analyses of the
dynamics and area of folded tissue shows the folding is *prd* embryos is more
similar to the ectopic folds than to the cephalic furrow invagination (Figure
X). This suggests the lack of *prd* activity is more important to the
patterning of the cephalic furrow than previously thought.

<!--Concluding differentness of ectopic folds-->

Overall these analyses show that ectopic folds forming in embryos lacking the
cephalic furrow have have different properties and dynamics compared to the
cephalic furrow, suggesting their formation is driven by different
developmental mechanisms.

<!--TODO: Analyses of tissue flow in the absence of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--We analyzed the tissue flow in cephalic furrow mutants using particle image velocimetry. We find that without the cephalic furrow the head--trunk boundary region remains static against the movement of the trunk tissues.-->

## Position of ectopic folds coincides with mitotic domains

<!--Ectopic folds appear between mitotic domains-->

To uncover what controls the position and formation of ectopic folds, we
analyzed how their formation correlates with the tissue dynamics at the
head--trunk boundary. We identified a correlation between ectopic folds and
mitotic domains (MD), groups of blastoderm cells that divide in synchrony
[@Foe1989-cw]. In most cases, the ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants
often occur between adjacent mitotic domains (@fig:mitotic). The most common
position is near the canonical cephalic furrow position.

In *btd* embryos which lack MD2 [@Edgar1994-pi], this ectopic fold forms
between MD5 and MD7, while in *eve* embryos which have an expanded MD2
[@Vincent1997-fa], an ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD2. Other positions
are more anterior between MD1 and MD9/MD5, a less common and shallower fold
between MD7 and MD6, and the most posterior ectopic fold which forms posterior
to MD6 ({@fig:mitotic}A--C). Thus ectopic folds occur adjacent to mitotic
domains.

<!--Ectopic folding coincides with area expansion of dividing cells-->

The analysis of the apical area of cells at the head--trunk interface revealed
the infolding of epithelial cells is preceded by the compression of cell apices
by the expansion of dividing cells in mitotic domains ({@fig:mitotic}D). The
apical area of epithelial cells about to fold inwards diminishes at the same
time that the apical area of dividing cells increase. The only exception occurs
in *btd* where we identified a reminiscent initiator cell behavior with a
narrow row of cells contracting their apices at the canonical cephalic furrow
position before the mitotic domains (Figure S). However, in this case the
tissue still only folds when the cells in adjacent mitotic domains undergo area
expansion during mitosis. 

<!--Ectopic folds form by tissue buckling rather than invagination-->

The dynamics of ectopic fold formation differs from the cephalic furrow
invagination. While the cephalic furrow forms by a progressive invagination,
the ectopic folds form by abrupt buckling of the tissue ({@fig:mitotic}E). The
epithelium buckles when compressed by adjacent dividing cells. Therefore, even
though the end result of ectopic folds might appear similar to the cephalic
furrow, the dynamics and formation process are rather different.

<!--Concluding mitotic coincidence and buckling-->

This correlation with the position and timing of mitotic domains indicates that
local mechanical forces in the tissue play a role in ectopic fold formation in
cephalic furrow mutants.

## Ectopic fold formation is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by the germ band extension

<!--## Concomitant expansion of head tissues by the mitotic domains and compression of trunk tissues by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--Double mutants without mitotic domains and cephalic furrow-->

To test whether the local tissue forces generated by the mitotic domains indeed
cause the formation of ectopic folds, we generated embryos that form neither
the cephalic furrow nor the mitotic domains. We used the loss of function
allele of *stg*, a gene that regulates the mitotic domains in the nuclear cycle
14 [@Edgar1989-hv], with the loss of function alleles for *btd* and for *eve*.

<!--Outcome where the tissue still buckles in double mutants-->

**[Hypothetical outcome]** In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double
mutants, the ectopic folds are still present (@fig:double), suggesting that
mitotic domains might facilitate the position of folding, but are not required
for their formation. This indicates that other mechanical forces acting during
gastrulation might be the driving force of ectopic folds at the head--trunk
interface.

<!--In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants, the ectopic folds are absent, suggesting the presence of mitotic domains is necessary for the formation of ectopic folds. This indicates they play a key role in the balance of local forces that lead to the formation of ectopic folds. -->

<!--Cauterization experiment to test germ band influence-->

We thus tested whether the germ band extension could be the driving force
generating ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary in cephalic furrow
mutants. Evidence for this came from the observation of ectopic folds forming
posterior to the MD6 which often showed compressed epithelial cells in the
dorsal region (Figure S). We tested this hypothesis by physically blocking the
germ band from extending in *btd* and *eve* mutants using laser cauterizations
(@fig:mutcauts).

<!--Blocking the germ band extension suppresses ectopic folds-->

Indeed, we found that when the germ band is mechanically blocked by the
cauterization, the tissues at the head--trunk boundary show no ectopic folds
and the epithelium is less irregular compared to the mutant embryos without
cauterization ({@fig:mutcauts}A,D,E). The mitotic domains are still present and
its dividing cells still cause a large expansion in the area of the head
tissues ({@fig:mutcauts}A). The apical area expansion of dividing cells
compress the non-dividing cells between mitotic domains, but the compression is
insufficient to cause the tissue to buckle in cauterized mutant embryos
({@fig:mutcauts}B,C and Video X).

<!--TODO: Estimate the expansion of head tissues in cauterized embryo-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

These experiments show the main driving force for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants comes from the global compression of trunk
tissues by the elongating germ band. When mitotic domains are present, the
dividing cells increase the local tissue interactions creating areas prone to
buckling, which bias the formation of ectopic folds.

**[Hypothetical outcome]** To complement our in vivo observations and
understand the interplay between local and global tissue interactions, we
developed a 1D linear model. The model corroborates the idea that tissue
compression from the germ band extension can trigger the head tissues to
buckle, given certain epithelial properties such as cell-to-cell adhesion and
rigidity remain constant ({@fig:mutcauts}F).

## Cephalic furrow invagination forms autonomously with small input from the germ band extension during normal embryogenesis

<!--Mitotic domains and germ band interactions in wild type-->

The finding that the germ band extension interacts with head tissues, led us to
ask whether the invagination of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis
is also pushed by the germ band elongation. The idea that mitotic domains and
the germ band could contribute to the cephalic furrow invagination has been
previously suggested [@Campos-Ortega1997-rd], and some recent work shows the
completion of the ventral furrow depends on the physical push from the ectoderm
[@Guo2021-sj]. To understand how the germ band extension interacts with the
cephalic furrow formation, we performed laser ablations and cauterizations in
wild type embryos at different locations in the embryo.

<!--Laser ablations in wild type suggest active CF-->

We first quantified the force the cephalic furrow creates in surrounding
tissues during the invagination process. We performed laser ablations and
measured the recoil velocity in the epithelium anterior and posterior to the
cephalic furrow (Figure laser ablation illustration). We observe the recoil
velocity of cell membranes decrease with the distance to the initiator cells
(Figure panel laser ablation). The distance until we observe no recoil is 40 ¬µm
from the initiator cells both anterior and posterior. This indicates the
cephalic furrow invagination actively pulls the epithelial cells at the onset
of gastrulation.

<!--Cauterization of wild type indicate mild GB to CF depth-->

We then tested whether the force generated by the germ band extension
contributes to the cephalic furrow invagination by blocking the germ band
elongation in wild type embryos. If the germ band is pushing the cephalic
furrow invagination, we expected to see a difference in cephalic furrow depth
in cauterized embryos. We find the cephalic furrow in cauterized embryos is
about 10% shallower than non-cauterized embryos (@fig:wildcauts). This
indicates a mild influence of the germ band extension in the process of
cephalic furrow invagination.

<!--GB influence in the position and dynamics of CF-->

The cauterization, however, has consequences to the dynamics and position of
the cephalic furrow. We observe that in cauterized embryos there is a posterior
shift in the dorsal portion of the cephalic furrow (@fig:wildcauts). This
posterior shift occurs with expansion of head tissues associated with the
initiation of mitotic domains. In non-cauterized embryos, the dorsal shift of
the cephalic furrow is contained by the expansion of the germ band. Despite not
having a significant effect in the depth of the cephalic furrow, the tissue
interactions at the dorsal portion of the embryo are largely influenced by the
germ band extension.

<!--Curiously, if the cauterization is unequal, the depth of the cephalic furrow on the left and right side are different. -->

<!--Analyses of mitotic domain single mutants-->

**[Hypothetical outcome]** In addition, we investigated whether the local
expansion caused by mitotic domains could influence the cephalic furrow depth.
We thus measured the cephalic furrow depth in *stg* mutants. We find a minor
effect to the cephalic furrow invagination depth, but observe an anterior shift
in the cephalic furrow position. This anterior shift coincides with the
progression of the germ band towards the head region which lacks the expansion
of head tissues due to the absence of mitotic domains.

<!--Cephalic furrow is mostly autonomous but interactions matter-->

Thus we find the mitotic domains and germ band extension play a minor role in
pushing the cephalic furrow into the yolk, but they can affect the positional
dynamics of cephalic furrow formation. The cephalic furrow morphogenesis is
governed by the orchestration of genetic patterning with mechanical forces in
the embryo.

# Discussion

## The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone prone to epithelial instability

The cephalic furrow has not been as studied as other morphogenetic movements in
Drosophila gastrulation. Only a few cephalic furrow mutants have been
identified and the mechanisms of patterning and morphogenesis remain
understudied to this day. Part of the reason is that the cephalic furrow is a
transient structure and to identify mutant phenotypes one has to image its
formation, since there are no known consequences of not forming the cephalic
furrow. Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be able to investigate the
cephalic furrow formation.

<!--Cephalic furrow cryptic mutants due to ectopic folding-->

Using live-imaging, we found that cephalic furrow mutants with a delayed furrow
in fact fail to form the invagination, but still form a ectopic fold at the
canonical cephalic furrow position. We describe this for gt and there are
likely other genes that might be affecting the cephalic furrow development, but
are cryptic because it requires live-imaging.

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is characterized by a
boundary of tissue movements. The forces involved are a relatively static head
tissues that undergo expansion due to mitotic domains, and an anterior and
ventral flow of trunk tissues driven by the germ band elongation.
The invaginated area analysis suggests some sort of compensation in the amount
of invaginated tissue. Suggesting that mechanical forces acting in the
monolayer epithelia, such as the expansion of dividing cells, or the
compression exerted by the germ band, might be causally connected to the tissue
buckling.

## Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by germ band elongation

This indicates the germ band extension is the driving force underlying the
ectopic epithelial folding, and that mitotic domains facilitate but are not
sufficient to cause the tissue to buckle. By cauterization experiments we show
the germ band extension causes epithelial compression at the head-trunk
boundary. While in strong phenotypes, embryos that fail to initiate the furrow,
the compression results in ectopic folds, in wild type embryos the compression
further deepens the furrow. This shows evidence of the long range global impact
the germ band extension exerts during gastrulation.

<!--Incorporate-->

Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation where the extension
of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk interface. This
interaction under normal embryogenesis pushes the cephalic furrow invagination
deeper in the yolk, providing a previously unknown physical component to the
cephalic furrow morphogenesis initiated independently by genetic means. Thus
revealing a global interaction between morphogenetic movements in Drosophila
gastrulation.

## Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position

Therefore, the role that the cephalic furrow appears to accomplish during
gastrulation is to anticipate these conflicts and prime, in a predictable
manner, the position that the tissue will fold. In doing so, the cephalic
furrow would prevent potential defects associated with erratic buckling, such
as the compromise of cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling in the
epithelia, and thus ensure a stereotypical balance of forces required for the
precise patterning of embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary,
to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic
furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow
accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ
band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable
invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus
preventing erratic epithelial buckling.

<!--## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes-->

The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement
initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 ¬µm wide, as
supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further
deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the
head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type
and mutants.

Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an
active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process.
That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are
identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the
process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process
caused by the germ band was not.

Overall, overall our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a
two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process
of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band
extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to
orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.

## Conclusions

Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions
involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in
Drosophila.

The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical
parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving
insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that
control morphogenesis.
