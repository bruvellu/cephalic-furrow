# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila melanogaster* during gastrulation. Despite being a
prominent trait, the mechanisms and forces controlling the formation of the
cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we investigate the developmental role of
the cephalic furrow in the global context of gastrulation by live imaging
mutant embryos under lightsheet microscopy. We find that embryos lacking a
cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds in variable positions at the
head--trunk interface. We show the formation of ectopic folds is the result of
the concomitant expansion of head tissues generated by mitotic domains, with
the compression of trunk tissues driven by the germ band elongation. We propose
the cephalic furrow act as a buffer to these opposing tissue interactions by
priming the position of folding at the head--trunk boundary early in
gastrulation.

<!--The cephalic furrow background-->

The cephalic furrow is a prominent morphogenetic movement of *Drosophila*
gastrulation. It is a deep invagination that appear as lateral indentations at
the onset of gastrulation, and covers from dorsal to ventral, subdividing the
yolk from head and trunk [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw]. Unlike the ventral
furrow, however, the cephalic furrow is a transient structure that unfolds
after a couple of hours, and the invaginated tissue is not associated with a
particular fate in the embryo. This prominent but ephemeral nature makes the
cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic traits of gastrulation, both in terms
of the processes controlling its formation and its physical developmental role.

<!--The morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow-->

The morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is poorly understood
[@Gilmour2017-um]. The cephalic furrow begins with a single row of initiator
cells that sink into the yolk. The process occurs through a coordinated series
of cell shape changes and tissue movements, beginning with the shortening of
initiator cells and basal expansion, and a second step which develops into a
progressive invagination [@Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi]. This process
differs from other movements and remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um;
@Vincent1997-fa], but is highly stereotypic. The cephalic furrow is positioned
with 1% precision [@Liu2013-lc], a patterning that could be achieved with only
four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf], suggesting there is precise genetic patterning
coordinating the cephalic furrow formation in space and time.

<!--Cephalic furrow mechanics-->

The physical role that the deep invagination of the cephalic furrow play in the
complex morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation remain elusive.
Modeling simulations have suggested the cephalic furrow can act as an anchor to
the tissue [@Allena2012-pb]. Others have speculated that the cephalic furrow
might balance the germ band extension [@PhysicalHypotheses]. However, the
interactions of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not
been investigated [@Kong2017-ac], and its role in the global context of
gastrulation and the interplay between patterning and morphogenesis remain
open.

<!--Cephalic furrow patterning and logic-->

The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead*
(*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve*
embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination
[@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is
delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or
delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the
head--trunk boundary, as well as the global dynamics of gastrulation.

<!--This study-->

To investigate the developmental roles of the cephalic furrow morphogenesis to
Drosophila gastrulation, we analyzed effects of disruptions in cephalic furrow
formation to other gastrulation movements using live-imaging and laser
cauterizations in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Summary of findings-->

<!--TODO: Summarize to single paragraph.-->

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to results).-->
We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow---not only *eve*
mutants but also *btd* mutants---invariably form late ectopic folds at the
head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ in timing, formation
dynamics, folded area, and morphology to the cephalic furrow, suggesting they
are indeed formed by different processes. The position and timing of folding
events varies between individual mutant embryos, but correlates with the
position of mitotic domains, and the epithelium often buckles abruptly between
the dividing cells with expanded apical areas, suggesting that local tissue
forces might cause the tissue to buckle.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to results).-->
To tested whether the local tissue forces driven by mitotic domains are causing
the ectopic folds, we analyzed double mutant embryos for stg btd and stg eve
which form neither the cephalic furrow nor the mitotic domains in cycle 14. We
find that ectopic folds are still formed in stg btd and stg eve double mutants,
suggesting that mitotic domains might influence the position, or facilitate the
folding, but are not required, suggesting that other tissue forces might be the
driving force for ectopic folds.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to results).-->
Next we asked whether the compression of tissues caused by the elongating germ
band could be driving ectopic fold formation. We tested this hypothesis by
blocking the germ band extension by cauterizing the posterodorsal region in
mutant embryos. We find the ectopic folds are absent when the germ band is
mechanically blocked by the cauterization, suggesting that the global tissue
compression caused by the germ band extension is the main force contributing to
the formation of ectopic folds.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to results).-->
Given the unexpected finding that the germ band influences head tissues, we
then tested whether the germ band extension and its resulting tissue
compression also contributes to the normal process of cephalic furrow
formation. We find that cauterized wild type embryos have a shallower cephalic
furrow, indicating that the tissue compression from the germ band extension
affects the amount of invaginated cephalic furrow tissue.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to discussion).-->
Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation where the extension
of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk interface. This
interaction under normal embryogenesis pushes the cephalic furrow invagination
deeper in the yolk, providing a previously unknown physical component to the
cephalic furrow morphogenesis initiated independently by genetic means. Thus
revealing a global interaction between morphogenetic movements in Drosophila
gastrulation.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to discussion).-->
Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary,
to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic
furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow
accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ
band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable
invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus
preventing erratic epithelial buckling.

<!--TODO: Summarize (moved to discussion).-->
Overall, overall our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a
two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process
of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band
extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to
orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.

# Results

## Cephalic furrow mutants form variable ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary

We studied cephalic furrow mutants to understand how defects in cephalic furrow
formation impact the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary during
gastrulation. We generated flies with a fluorescent background and
loss-of-function alleles for the cephalic furrow genes *buttonhead* (*btd*),
*even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*), and acquired *in toto* live
imaging data of mutant embryos using lightsheet microscopy.

<!--Late ectopic folds form in CF mutants-->

In *btd* and *eve* mutant embryos, the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate and
is entirely absent [@Vincent1997-fa]. However, an intriguing late fold was
observed in the cephalic region of *eve* mutants [@Vincent1997-fa]. Our live
imaging data corroborate this observation in *eve* mutants, and reveals that
*btd* embryos also form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface during
gastrulation (@fig:ectopic).

<!--Motivation to analyze ectopic fold formation-->

To understand the origin of these ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants, we
analyzed how the pattern, dynamics, and variability of folding events compared
to the cephalic furrow formation. 

<!--Ectopic folds form late-->

We first detect ectopic folds late during gastrulation. While the cephalic
furrow in wild type embryos forms in stage 6, at the onset of gastrulation, the
ectopic folds in mutant embryos only appear in stage 8, when the germ band has
already extended at least a third of the embryo length ({@fig:ectopic}A, Video
1 and 2). Unlike the stereotypic morphology of the cephalic furrow, the ectopic
folds are often asymmetric, have a looser cleft between edges, and lack the
typical cell shapes at the invagination tip and edges ({@fig:ectopic}B). The
number of ectopic folds on each side of the embryo varies between one to four.
Mutant embryos without ectopic folds were rare.

<!--Dynamics are different-->

The dynamics of ectopic folding differs from the canonical cephalic furrow
formation. By tracing the position of the ectopic folds in the blastoderm
across time, we find the starting angle of ectopic folds is generally tilted in
relation to the cephalic furrow (TODO). The cephalic furrow initiates as a
straight dorsoventral line which progressively bends into a curved line, while
its dorsal portion shifts to the posterior end and its ventral portion shifts
to the anterior end ({@fig:variability}A). In contrast the ectopic folds are
mostly straight over time and do not extend as far dorsal or ventral as the
cephalic furrow ({@fig:variability}B,C).

<!--Ectopic folding area and depth smaller than CF invagination-->

To estimate the area of epithelial tissue folded inside ectopic folds, we
created a cartographic projection of the embryos by fitting its surface to a
cylinder and unwrapping the cylinder as a flat surface. We then tracked the
infolded cells backwards and demarcated the folded region on the blastoderm
before gastrulation ({@fig:variability}D--F). We find the total area of folded
tissue contained in the ectopic folds of *btd* and *eve* embryos is roughly
half that of cephalic furrow in sibling controls ({@fig:variability}G). We also
measured the depth of the ectopic folds and found a similar result
({@fig:variability}H).

<!--Ectopic folds vary between individual mutant embryos-->

We noticed that individual mutant embryos not only have different numbers of
ectopic folds, but that the position of these folds in the blastoderm vary from
embryo to embryo. We compiled the tracing data normalized by embryo length to
understand the distribution of ectopic folds along the head--trunk interface.
The data reveals the position of ectopic folds vary greatly compared to the
position of the cephalic furrow formation on the lateral blastoderm
({@fig:variability}I). The ectopic folds, either in *btd* or in *eve* mutants,
can occur near the canonical cephalic furrow region, but also occur in more
anterior or more posterior positions. The formation of ectopic folds can even
differ between the left and right side of the same embryo
({@fig:variability}J). This variability is in stark contrast to the stereotypic
formation of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis, suggesting the
process of ectopic fold formation might be driven by stochastic events and
mechanical forces in the epithelial tissue.

<!--TODO: We observe that individual mutant embryos can have the same total invaginated area either having one deep fold or two shallower folds.-->

<!--Sidenote for paired-->

In addition, we analyzed *prd* embryos where the formation of the cephalic
furrow is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. Although *prd* embryos seem to form a
cephalic furrow at the expected position, our live imaging reveals the process
of invagination initiates but halts mid way through (Figure X). Analyses of the
dynamics and area of folded tissue shows the folding is *prd* embryos is more
similar to the ectopic folds than to the cephalic furrow invagination (Figure
X). This suggests the lack of *prd* activity is more important to the
patterning of the cephalic furrow than previously thought.

<!--Concluding differentness of ectopic folds-->

Overall these analyses show that ectopic folds forming in embryos lacking the
cephalic furrow have have different properties and dynamics compared to the
cephalic furrow, suggesting their formation is driven by different
developmental mechanisms.

<!--TODO: Analyses of tissue flow in the absence of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--We analyzed the tissue flow in cephalic furrow mutants using particle image velocimetry. We find that without the cephalic furrow the head--trunk boundary region remains static against the movement of the trunk tissues.-->

## Position of ectopic folds coincides with mitotic domains

<!--Ectopic folds appear between mitotic domains-->

To uncover what controls the position and formation of ectopic folds, we
analyzed how their formation correlates with the tissue dynamics at the
head--trunk boundary. We identified a correlation between ectopic folds and
mitotic domains (MD). In most cases, the ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve*
mutants often occur between adjacent mitotic domains (@fig:mitotic). The most
common position is near the canonical cephalic furrow position. In *btd* embryos
which lack MD2 [@CiteMD2btd], this ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD7,
while in eve embryos which have an expanded MD2 [@CiteMD2eve], an ectopic fold
forms between MD5 and MD2. Other positions are more anterior between MD1 and
MD9/MD5, a less common and shallower fold between MD7 and MD6, and the most
posterior ectopic fold which forms posterior to MD6 ({@fig:mitotic}A--C). Thus
ectopic folds occur adjacent to mitotic domains.

<!--Ectopic folding coincides with area expansion of dividing cells-->

The analysis of the apical area of cells at the head--trunk interface revealed
the infolding of epithelial cells is preceded by the compression of cell apices
by the expansion of dividing cells in mitotic domains ({@fig:mitotic}D). The
apical area of epithelial cells about to fold inwards diminishes at the same
time that the apical area of dividing cells increase. The only exception occurs
in *btd* where we identified a reminiscent initiator cell behavior with a
narrow row of cells contracting their apices at the canonical cephalic furrow
position before the mitotic domains (Figure S). However, in this case the
tissue still only folds when the cells in adjacent mitotic domains undergo area
expansion during mitosis. 

<!--Ectopic folds form by tissue buckling rather than invagination-->

The dynamics of ectopic fold formation differs from the cephalic furrow
invagination. While the cephalic furrow forms by a progressive invagination,
the ectopic folds form by abrupt buckling of the tissue ({@fig:mitotic}E). The epithelium simply buckles when compressed by
adjacent dividing cells. Therefore, even though the end result of ectopic folds
might appear similar to the cephalic furrow, the dynamics and formation process
are rather different.

<!--Concluding mitotic coincidence and buckling-->

Thus the fact that ectopic fold formation coincides in position and timing with
the expansion in the area of dividing cells during mitosis, suggests that local
tissue mechanical forces might be at play and causing the tissue to buckle.

## Ectopic fold formation is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by the germ band extension

<!--## Concomitant expansion of head tissues by the mitotic domains and compression of trunk tissues by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--Double mutants without mitotic domains and cephalic furrow-->

To test whether the local tissue forces generated by the mitotic domains indeed
cause the formation of ectopic folds, we generated embryos that form neither
the cephalic furrow nor the mitotic domains. We used the loss of function
allele of *stg*, a gene that regulates the mitotic domains in the nuclear cycle
14 [@Edgar1989-hv], with the loss of function alleles for *btd* and for *eve*.

<!--Outcome where the tissue still buckles in double mutants-->

[Hypothetical outcome] In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants,
the ectopic folds are still present (@fig:double), suggesting that
mitotic domains might facilitate the position of folding, but are not required
for their formation. This indicates that other mechanical forces acting during
gastrulation might be the driving force of ectopic folds at the head--trunk
interface.

<!--In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants, the ectopic folds are absent, suggesting the presence of mitotic domains is necessary for the formation of ectopic folds. This indicates they play a key role in the balance of local forces that lead to the formation of ectopic folds. -->

<!--Cauterization experiment to test germ band influence-->

We tested whether the germ band extension could be the driving force generating
ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary in cephalic furrow mutants. Evidence
for this came from the observation of ectopic folds forming posterior to the
MD6 which often showed compressed epithelial cells in the dorsal region (Figure
S). We tested this hypothesis by physically blocking the germ band from
extending in *btd* and *eve* mutants using laser cauterizations (@fig:mutcauts).

<!--Blocking the germ band extension suppresses ectopic folds-->

Indeed, we found that when the germ band is mechanically blocked by the
cauterization, the tissue at the head--trunk boundary show no ectopic folds and
the epithelium is less irregular compared to the mutant embryos without
cauterization ({@fig:mutcauts}A,D,E). The mitotic domains are still
present and its dividing cells still cause a large expansion in the area of the
head tissues ({@fig:mutcauts}A). The apical area expansion of dividing
cells compress the non-dividing cells between mitotic domains, but the
compression is insufficient to cause the tissue to buckle in cauterized mutant
embryos ({@fig:mutcauts}B,C and Video X).

<!--TODO: Estimate the expansion of head tissues in cauterized embryo-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

These experiments show the main driving force for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants comes from the global compression of trunk
tissues by the elongating germ band. When mitotic domains are present, the
dividing cells increase the local tissue interactions creating areas prone to
buckling, which bias the formation of ectopic folds.

We developed a 1D linear model to better understand the interplay of local and
global tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. The model corroborates
the idea that tissue compression from the germ band extension can trigger the
head tissues to buckle, given certain epithelial properties such as
cell-to-cell adhesion and rigidity remain constant ({@fig:mutcauts}F).

## Mitotic domains and germ band contributions to cephalic furrow formation during normal embryogenesis

<!--Mitotic domains and germ band interactions in wild type-->

The finding that the germ band extension interacts with head tissues, led us to
ask whether the invagination of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis
is also pushed by the germ band elongation. The idea that mitotic domains and
the germ band could contribute to the cephalic furrow invagination has been
previously suggested [@Hartenstein], and some recent work shows the completion
of the ventral furrow depends on the physical push from the ectoderm [@BingHe].

<!--Cauterization of wild type-->

To test this hypothesis, we blocked the germ band elongation in wild type
embryos by cauterization prior to gastrulation. We find that cauterized wild
type embryos do have a cephalic furrow about 10% shallower than sibling
controls, but the relation is hardly significant (@fig:wildcauts). Curiously,
if the cauterization is unequal, the depth of the cephalic furrow on the left
and right side are different. In addition, we observe a posterior shift in the
dorsal position of the cephalic furrow when the germ band is blocked from
extending (@fig:wildcauts).

<!--Analyses of mitotic domain single mutants-->

[Hypothetical outcome] In addition we measured the cephalic furrow depth in stg
mutants to evaluate if the expansion of mitotic domains contributed to increase
the depth of the invagination. Similar to the cauterization experiment, we
found a minor effect of the absence of mitotic domains to the cephalic furrow
depth, but an anterior shift in the cephalic furrow position.

<!--Cephalic furrow is mostly autonomous but interactions matter-->

These experiments suggest the mitotic domains and germ band extension play a
minor role in pushing the cephalic furrow into the yolk, but they can affect
the positional dynamics of cephalic furrow formation, suggesting the cephalic
furrow morphogenesis is governed by the orchestration of genetic patterning
with mechanical forces in the embryo.

# Discussion

## The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone prone to epithelial instability

The cephalic furrow has not been as studied as other morphogenetic movements in
Drosophila gastrulation. Only a few cephalic furrow mutants have been
identified and the mechanisms of patterning and morphogenesis remain
understudied to this day. Part of the reason is that the cephalic furrow is a
transient structure and to identify mutant phenotypes one has to image its
formation, since there are no known consequences of not forming the cephalic
furrow. Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be able to investigate the
cephalic furrow formation.

<!--Cephalic furrow cryptic mutants due to ectopic folding-->

Using live-imaging, we found that cephalic furrow mutants with a delayed furrow
in fact fail to form the invagination, but still form a ectopic fold at the
canonical cephalic furrow position. We describe this for gt and there are
likely other genes that might be affecting the cephalic furrow development, but
are cryptic because it requires live-imaging.

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is characterized by a
boundary of tissue movements. The forces involved are a relatively static head
tissues that undergo expansion due to mitotic domains, and an anterior and
ventral flow of trunk tissues driven by the germ band elongation.
The invaginated area analysis suggests some sort of compensation in the amount
of invaginated tissue. Suggesting that mechanical forces acting in the
monolayer epithelia, such as the expansion of dividing cells, or the
compression exerted by the germ band, might be causally connected to the tissue
buckling.

## Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by germ band elongation

This indicates the germ band extension is the driving force underlying the
ectopic epithelial folding, and that mitotic domains facilitate but are not
sufficient to cause the tissue to buckle. By cauterization experiments we show
the germ band extension causes epithelial compression at the head-trunk
boundary. While in strong phenotypes, embryos that fail to initiate the furrow,
the compression results in ectopic folds, in wild type embryos the compression
further deepens the furrow. This shows evidence of the long range global impact
the germ band extension exerts during gastrulation.

<!--Incorporate-->

Our data reveals long-range interaction during gastrulation where the extension
of the germ band compresses tissues at the head--trunk interface. This
interaction under normal embryogenesis pushes the cephalic furrow invagination
deeper in the yolk, providing a previously unknown physical component to the
cephalic furrow morphogenesis initiated independently by genetic means. Thus
revealing a global interaction between morphogenetic movements in Drosophila
gastrulation.

## Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position

Therefore, the role that the cephalic furrow appears to accomplish during
gastrulation is to anticipate these conflicts and prime, in a predictable
manner, the position that the tissue will fold. In doing so, the cephalic
furrow would prevent potential defects associated with erratic buckling, such
as the compromise of cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling in the
epithelia, and thus ensure a stereotypical balance of forces required for the
precise patterning of embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary,
to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic
furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow
accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ
band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable
invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus
preventing erratic epithelial buckling.

<!--## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes-->

The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement
initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 ¬µm wide, as
supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further
deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the
head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type
and mutants.

Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an
active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process.
That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are
identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the
process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process
caused by the germ band was not.

Overall, overall our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a
two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process
of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band
extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to
orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.

## Conclusions

Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions
involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in
Drosophila.

The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical
parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving
insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that
control morphogenesis.
