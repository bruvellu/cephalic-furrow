# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep invagination that demarcates the head--trunk
boundary of *Drosophila melanogaster* during gastrulation. Despite being a
prominent trait, the mechanisms and forces controlling the formation of the
cephalic furrow remains elusive. Here, we investigate the developmental role of
the cephalic furrow in the global context of gastrulation by live imaging
mutant embryos under lightsheet microscopy. We find that embryos lacking a
cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds in variable positions at the
head--trunk interface. We show the formation of ectopic folds is the result of
the concomitant epithelial expansion generated by mitotic domains, with the
compression driven by the germ band elongation. We propose the cephalic furrow
act as a buffer to these opposing tissue interactions by priming the position
of folding at the head--trunk boundary early in gastrulation.

# Introduction

<!--Cephalic furrow is a prominent landmark-->

The cephalic furrow is a prominent epithelial invagination that forms at the
head--trunk boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. It is one of the
first morphogenetic movements in the embryo [@Hartenstein1985-zs; @Foe1989-cw]
and begins as narrow lateral indentations. The invagination quickly extends to
the dorsal and ventral sides, and invaginate deep into the yolk sac, becoming a
significant structure at an important landmark of the embryo, the head--trunk
boundary.

<!--Cephalic furrow formation is precisely patterned-->

The formation of the cephalic furrow is determined genetically. The position is
determined by the overlap between the zygotic expression of *buttonhead*
(*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*) stripe 1 [@Vincent1997-fa]. This narrow row
of initiator cells undergo a coordinated series of cell shape changes, sink
below the epithelial basal lamina and progressively invaginate into the yolk
[@Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi]. A mechanical coupling between epithelial
cells ensures the precision of the fold [@Eritano2020-mi] and the cephalic
furrow is positioned with 1% accuracy along the embryo length [@Liu2013-lc].
This reveals there is a precise stereotypic genetic patterning in place
coordinating the timing and position of cephalic furrow formation during
gastrulation, suggesting it must be good for something.

<!--Cephalic furrow developmental role is unclear-->

However, unlike the ventral furrow, however, the invaginated cells do not give
rise to any particular tissue. It is a dead end of folded cells. In addition,
the cephalic furrow is transient, unfolding after a couple of hours of
gastrulation before germ band retraction [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].
This prominent but ephemeral existence makes the cephalic furrow one of the
most enigmatic traits of gastrulation (@fig:headtrunk), raising the question if
the cephalic furrow has a mechanical/physical rather than patterning/regulatory
role during gastrulation.

<!--Cephalic furrow physical role-->

The physical role of the cephalic furrow has been investigated in silico.
Numerical approaches suggest the cephalic furrow might play a global role to
the complex morphogenetic movements of gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb;
@Dicko2017-wz]. One hypothesis is that the cephalic furrow act as a barrier to
the tissue flows and orients the germ band extension towards the posterior
[@Dicko2017-wz]. However, the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other
gastrulation movements have not been investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac].

<!--Approach of this study-->

Here we investigate the mechanical role of the cephalic furrow by analyzing how
defects in cephalic furrow formation impact the local tissue interactions at
the head--trunk boundary and the global dynamics of gastrulation.

<!--Summary of findings-->

We find that when the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, the epithelia at the
head--trunk interface shows unpredictable deformations and buckling events. We
show the tissue buckling is the result of mechanical forces acting on the
monolayer epithelia and influenced by two key players, the expansion of apical
cell area by mitotic domains and the tissue compression by germ band extension.
These events create a convergent flow at the head--trunk boundary. Without the
formation of the cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the head--trunk
boundary inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably. During normal
embryogenesis, the genetically-determined cephalic furrow predictably
anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions and primes the position of
folding at the head--trunk boundary. The cephalic furrow invagination directs
tissue flow storing a significant amount of epithelial area thus preventing
epithelial instability. We thus propose the cephalic furrow acts as a temporary
buffer for the conflicting tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary
during gastrulation.

<!--Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--We used live-imaging and laser cauterizations in cephalic furrow mutants.-->

<!--Interestingly, in *eve* embryos where the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, a late fold appears in the cephalic region [@Vincent1997-fa]. The origin of this late fold is unclear whether it is a reminiscent of the cephalic furrow patterning or formed by other developmental mechanisms. Thus, the physical role in the global dynamics of *Drosophila* gastrulation remains poorly understood.-->

<!--This process remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Mutants for either *btd* or *eve* fail to initiate the cephalic furrow [@Vincent1997-fa]. -->

<!--a patterning that can be achieved with only four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf]-->

<!--The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead* (*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve* embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination [@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--A tissue fold can put epithelial cells in close contact and initiate cell-to-cell communication important for the patterning of blastoderm cells, but so far there is no evidence.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow is genetically-defined with a precise stereotypic timing and position. The invagination is large extending from dorsal to ventral and deep sinking almost the whole yolk invagination at an important anatomical landmark of the embryo, the head--trunk boundary. Yet, the cephalic furrow, unlike the ventral furrow, does not give rise to a particular cell fates and is transient, this massive structure progressively unfolds before germ band retraction. These features, being a major but transient structure make the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic morphogenetic movements in *Drosophila* gastrulation (@fig:headtrunk).-->

<!--Cephalic furrow directs convergent tissue flow preventing epithelial deformations at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ from the cephalic furrow in timing, formation dynamics, folded area, and morphology. The number and position of ectopic folds across the anteroposterior axis varies between individual mutant embryos. We show the timing and position of ectopic folds correlates with the formation of mitotic domains, suggesting that local tissue interactions are causing the tissue to buckle. These local interactions, however, are not sufficient to generate ectopic folds. Using laser cauterizations to mechanically block the germ band extension, we show the occurrence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary depends on the global tissue compression caused by the germ band extension, and that this interaction also contributes to the cephalic furrow formation in normal embryogenesis.-->

<!--Our analyses reveal the head--trunk boundary is a convergent zone of tissue interactions during gastrulation being orchestrated by two morphogenetic events, the mitotic domains causing the expansion of head tissues, and the germ band causing the compression of trunk tissues. Without the formation of the cephalic furrow, the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary will inevitably cause the epithelia to buckle unpredictably. Thus, we propose the cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

# Results

<!--Cephalic furrow mutants form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary-->

The cephalic furrow formation is a dynamic and transient process that occurs
concomitantly with other complex morphogenetic movements of gastrulation. To
understand how the tissue dynamics at the head--trunk boundary is affected by
the lack of the cephalic furrow, we studied cephalic furrow mutants under
live-imaging. We used flies with loss-of-function alleles for *btd* or *eve*,
which fail to initiate the cephalic furrow, to establish stocks with a green
balancer over the mutant allele, and a fluorescent membrane marker for the
imaging. We then imaged the embryos using lightsheet microscopy under
high-temporal resolution.

<!--Late ectopic folds form in CF mutants-->

The cephalic furrow fails to initiate at the onset of gastrulation in *btd* and
*eve* mutants (@fig:ectopic). In later stages of gastrulation, however, we
detect the occurrence of late folds at the head--trunk interface in both *btd*
and *eve* mutants, and reveal that *btd* embryos also form late ectopic folds
at the during gastrulation (@fig:ectopic). While the cephalic furrow in wild
type embryos forms in stage 6, at the onset of gastrulation, the ectopic folds
in mutant embryos only appear in stage 8, when the germ band has already
extended at least a third of the embryo length ({@fig:ectopic}A, Video 1 and
2). Unlike the stereotypic morphology of the cephalic furrow, the ectopic folds
are often asymmetric, have a wider cleft, and lack the typical cell
morphologies at the invagination tip and edges ({@fig:ectopic}B). Ectopic folds
thus form late and have irregular morphology.

<!--TODO: Figure with shape analysis of ectopic folds.-->

<!--Ectopic folds vary between individual mutant embryos-->

<!--Dynamics of ectopic folds is different from CF-->

<!--TODO: Mention the ectopic folds unfold overtime quicker than CF-->

We traced the formation of ectopic folds at the head--trunk epithelia to
analyze the dynamics, their position, and the area of folded tissue in ectopic
folds. The number of ectopic in mutants range from one to four on each side of
the embryos, and that mutants without ectopic folds were rare (Table X). The
cephalic furrow initiates as a straight orthogonal line whose dorsal portion
progressively shifts to the posterior, while its ventral portion shifts to the
anterior, the invagination extends to the dorsal and ventral sides bending the
initial straight line ({@fig:variability}A). In contrast, the ectopic folds
generally appear tilted with an angle (not orthogonal) to the anteroposterior
axis, they remain straight over time not bending, and they stay within the
lateral portion without extending as far dorsal or ventral as the cephalic
furrow ({@fig:variability}B,C). Thus, the dynamics of ectopic fold formation
differ from the canonical cephalic furrow formation.

<!--TODO: Measure angles and other quantitative measures from traces-->

We then analyzed the position of folding events along the head--trunk interface
and found it varies from embryo-to-embryo. We analyzed the distribution of
folding events between mutant embryos, and find the position of ectopic folds
vary compared to the position of the cephalic furrow formation on the lateral
blastoderm ({@fig:variability}I). The formation of ectopic folds can even
differ between the left and right side of the same embryo
({@fig:variability}J). Thus, in contrast to the predictable cephalic furrow,
the formation of ectopic folds varies from embryo to embryo.

<!--The ectopic folds, either in *btd* or in *eve* mutants, can occur near the canonical cephalic furrow region, but also occur in more anterior or more posterior positions.-->

<!--This variability is in stark contrast to the stereotypic formation of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis, suggesting the process of ectopic fold formation might be driven by stochastic events and mechanical forces in the epithelial tissue.-->

<!--TODO: Table with main annotated datasets-->

<!--Ectopic folds appear next to mitotic domains-->

We found a correlation between the ectopic folds and mitotic domains
(MD)---groups of blastoderm cells that divide in synchrony [@Foe1989-cw].
Ectopic folds in mutant embryos form next to or in between mitotic domains
(@fig:mitotic). A common position for the formation of ectopic folds is near
the canonical place of the cephalic furrow formation. In *btd* embryos this
ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD7 (*btd* mutants lack MD2
[@Edgar1994-pi]). In *eve* embryos this ectopic fold forms between MD5 and MD2
(*eve* mutants have an expanded MD2 [@Vincent1997-fa]). Ectopic folds also form
at a more anterior position, between between MD1 and MD9/MD5 in both *btd* and
*eve* mutants. The posterior-most ectopic fold we detect forms posterior to MD6
({@fig:mitotic}A--C). More rarely *btd* embryos form a shallower fold between
MD7 and MD6. Thus, these observations indicate the position of ectopic folds is
variable but not random; they are in most cases associated with the mitotic
domains.

<!--Ectopic folding coincides with area expansion of dividing cells-->
<!--Ectopic folds form by tissue buckling rather than invagination-->

The timing of ectopic folding also coincides with mitotic domains. We analyzed
the apical area of cells during ectopic fold formation. The apices of the
epithelial cells about to fold inwards are compressed progressively by the
apical expansion of dividing cells in the adjacent mitotic domains
({@fig:mitotic}D). The expansion of dividing cells thus always precede the
formation of the ectopic folds, and they form by abrupt buckling of the tissue
instead of the progressive invagination characteristic of the cephalic furrow
({@fig:mitotic}E). Thus, we find the formation of ectopic folds only occurs
after the epithelial compression caused by the apical expansion of mitotic
cells. Also the dynamics of the process is rather different than the cephalic
furrow, even though the end result---an epithelial fold---might appear similar.

<!--TODO: Quantify the apical area for ectopic fold surroundings-->

<!--TODO: Panel showing apical area upon ectopic fold formation-->

<!--The only exception occurs in the canonical cephalic furrow position of *btd* embryos where we detect the narrowing of apical cell area before expansion of adjacent mitotic domains (see @slppaper), although the tissue only folds when the cells in adjacent mitotic domains undergo area expansion during mitosis.-->

<!--Concluding mitotic coincidence and buckling-->

<!--We thus find a correlation in space and time between the formation of mitotic domains and ectopic folds. This tissue dynamics and the cell shape analysis indicate that local mechanical forces in the tissue play a role in ectopic fold formation in *btd* and *eve* mutants.-->

<!--Ectopic folding area and depth smaller than CF invagination-->

Finally, we estimated the area of epithelial tissue inside the ectopic folds.
We first projected the surface of the embryo as a flat plane, backtracked
the infolded cells of individual ectopic folds of mutant embryos, and
demarcated the folded region on the blastoderm before gastrulation
({@fig:variability}D--F). We measured the area of individual ectopic folds and
the total folded area per embryo. We find that both ectopic folds and the total
area of folded tissue per embryo in *btd* and *eve* mutants is roughly half
that of the invaginated area of the cephalic furrow in sibling controls
({@fig:variability}G). We have also directly measured the depth of ectopic
folds in frontal view datasets, and obtained the same result that ectopic folds
are shallower than the cephalic furrow invagination ({@fig:variability}H). The
amount of tissue in ectopic folds is smaller than in the cephalic furrow of
wild type embryos.

<!--TODO: We observe that individual mutant embryos can have the same total invaginated area either having one deep fold or two shallower folds.-->

<!--Concluding differentness of ectopic folds-->

We thus find that embryos lacking the cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds.
The formation of ectopic folds is different from the cephalic furrow in terms
of number, position, dynamics and area. Importantly, ectopic fold formation is
variable across embryos, in contrast to the stereotypic cephalic furrow
formation in sibling controls and wild type. These analyses indicate the
formation of ectopic folds is driven by different developmental mechanisms than
the cephalic furrow, possibly influenced by stochastic events and mechanical
forces in the epithelial tissue.

<!--TODO: Analyses of tissue flow in the absence of the cephalic furrow-->

<!--We analyzed the tissue flow in cephalic furrow mutants using particle image velocimetry. We find that without the cephalic furrow the head--trunk boundary region remains static against the movement of the trunk tissues.-->

<!--## Ectopic folds form next to mitotic domains-->

<!--## Tissue compression generated by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--## Ectopic fold formation is facilitated by mitotic domains but driven by the germ band extension-->

<!--## Concomitant expansion of head tissues by the mitotic domains and compression of trunk tissues by the germ band extension drives ectopic fold formation-->

<!--Double mutants without mitotic domains and cephalic furrow-->

To test whether the tissue expansion generated by mitotic domains play a role
in the formation of ectopic folds, we generated double mutant embryos lacking
the cephalic furrow and the mitotic domains. We combined our fluorescent lines
carrying the loss of function alleles for *btd* and *eve* with a loss of
function allele for *stg*, a gene that regulates the formation of mitotic
domains in the nuclear cycle 14 [@Edgar1989-hv]. We then imaged *stg*--*btd*
and *stg*--*eve* double mutants using our lightsheet pipeline, and find
**[hypothetical outcome]** the ectopic folds are still present in double mutant
embryos which lack mitotic domains (@fig:double). We observe, however, a
different distribution of folding events when compared to the single mutant
embryos (@fig:double). This indicates the expansion forces exerted in mitotic
domains are not required for the formation of ectopic folds, but their
presence, as observed in single *btd* and *eve* mutants, bias the position of
buckling events in the absence of the cephalic furrow.

<!--In both *stg*--*btd* and *stg*--*eve* double mutants, the ectopic folds are absent, suggesting the presence of mitotic domains is necessary for the formation of ectopic folds. This indicates they play a key role in the balance of local forces that lead to the formation of ectopic folds. -->


<!--TODO: Tissue flow analyses before MD-->

<!--TODO: Place this paragraph correctly-->

We analyzed the tissue flows in cephalic furrow mutants in using PIV analysis.
In wild type embryogenesis the region of the head--trunk boundary shows a
characteristic pattern at the onset of gastrulation (before germ band extension
and mitotic domains). There is a strong flow towards the ventral region at the
lateral epithelium due to the ventral furrow invagination, while the head
tissues and dorsal trunk tissues have no direction. Once the cephalic furrow
initiates it directs the flow towards ventral of the dorsal tissues and a
clockwise flow pattern in the head, with dorsal tissues moving posteriorly and
ventrally while ventral head tissues move anteriorly and dorsally. The center
of the hurricane sits at the ventral portion of the head region just anterior
to the cephalic furrow. In the absence of the cephalic furrow, the ventral flow
is restricted to more posterior trunk tissues, while head tissues show more
variable directions despite also flowing dorsally. We also observe shear
effects to epithelial cells in cephalic furrow mutants. Once gastrulation
proceeds we observe an increased flow and a stronger tissue flow towards the
anterior due to the germ band elongation. These analysis show the flow pattern
is disrupted in cephalic furrow mutants and the head--trunk boundary as a
convergent zone.

<!--Cauterization experiment to test germ band influence-->

The presence of ectopic folds in double mutants indicate that other mechanical
forces acting during gastrulation are driving the formation of ectopic folds at
the head--trunk interface. The tissue flows during germ band extension and the
formation of a ectopic fold posterior to MD6 against compressed epithelial
cells in the dorsal trunk region (@fig:comp), suggests the germ band extension
could driving the formation of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary in the
absence of the cephalic furrow. We tested this hypothesis by mechanically
blocking the germ band extension in *btd* and *eve* mutants by cauterizing the
blastoderm tissue to the vitelline envelope (@fig:mutcauts).

<!--Blocking the germ band extension suppresses ectopic folds-->

We find that cauterized mutant embryos show no ectopic folds at the head--trunk
boundary. While the epithelium of *btd* and *eve* mutants folds in different
positions ({@fig:ectopic}D and {@fig:mutcauts}B,C}), the epithelium in
cauterized embryos is regular with most cell apices facing the vitelline
envelope ({@fig:mutcauts}B,C). We quantified the epithelial deformations during
50 min from the onset of gastrulation and find the tortuosity in non-cauterized
mutants is significantly larger than in cauterized mutants
({@fig:mutcauts}D,E). While the expansion of dividing cells in mitotic domains
still displace and compress non-dividing cells at the head--trunk boundary
({@fig:mutcauts}D), this compression is insufficient to cause the tissue to
buckle ({@fig:mutcauts}B,C and Video X). These experiments reveal the main
driving force for the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants is
the compression of trunk tissues caused by the elongating germ band. 

<!--TODO: Estimate the expansion of head tissues in cauterized embryo-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

<!--When mitotic domains are present, the dividing cells generate areas prone to buckling, which bias the formation of ectopic folds. However, the germ band extension is what drives the formation of ectopic folds.-->

<!--Local tissue strain and global stiffness modulate ectopic folding-->

We tested how the mitotic strain might bias the position of folding and how the
mechanical force from the germ band leads to tissue buckling by developing a 1D
linear model. **[Hypothetical outcome]** To complement our in vivo observations
and understand the interplay between local and global tissue interactions, we
developed a 1D linear model that represents the epithelium of a gastrulating
embryo. We adapted a previous model and reached the set of parameters that
reproduced epithelial behavior in different conditions in vivo. We first tested
whether local tissue strain generated by mitotic expansion would cause ectopic
folds and found it does. However, the formation of ectopic folds depend on
global stiffness of the tissue, and below a certain threshold no ectopic folds
form (@fig:model).

# Discussion

<!--General introduction to cephalic furrow topic-->

The cephalic furrow remains the least understood morphogenetic movements of
*Drosophila* gastrulation. Its transient nature makes the cephalic furrow
particularly challenging to investigate, and partly the reason why only a few
mutants have been identified. Therefore, live-imaging is a key approach to be
able to investigate the cephalic furrow formation.

<!--The head-trunk boundary is a shear zone-->

Our tissue flow suggest that the head-trunk interface is a convergent zone of
tissue flow during gastrulation. In early stages the relatively static head
tissues contrast with the ventral-moving trunk tissues. In wild type this
ventral flow is directed and enhanced by the active pull from the cephalic
furrow, while in mutants the flow more variable and restricted more
posteriorly. A similar flow has been predicted numerically where the formation
of the cephalic furrow would direct the tissue flows of the entire embryo
[@ref]. That is what we observe in vivo in cephalic furrow mutants.

<!--Late forces lead to epithelial instability-->

<!--Ectopic folding is facilitated by mitotic domains-->

In late stages we describe the presence of ectopic folds in the head--trunk
epithelia in the absence of the cephalic furrow. Our analyses suggest that
mechanical rather than genetic forces underlie the instability in the monolayer
epithelia which leads to tissue buckling. Mechanical folds occur in... [@refs]
and are influenced by this and that. The influence of mitotic forces in
adjacent cells is being investigated [@ref]. They have been shown to exert
forces during expansion [@ref], and associated with the formation of ectopic
folds by creating an imbalance of forces in contractile tissues [@ref]. We find
the expansion of mitotic domains indeed influences the stability of adjacent
tissues and bias the position of folding events. The in silico model reveals
the mitotic strain leads to buckling only when the tissue is next to a stiffer
tissue.

<!--Germ band elongation is required for ectopic folds-->

Unexpectedly, we determined this influence to be from the germ band extension
at the head--trunk boundary via tissue compression. This shows evidence of the
long range global impact the germ band extension exerts during gastrulation.
The interactions between gastrulation movements have been investigated in...
[@ref] for this and that. These works have shown how tissue interactions shape
morphogenesis but usually on a shorter range. Our data reveals long-range
interaction during gastrulation where the extension of the germ band compresses
tissues at the head--trunk interface.

<!--TODO: Discussion tissue fluidity here?-->

<!--Cephalic furrow invagination anticipates and primes folding position-->

Overall, our data suggests that in the absence of the cephalic furrow, the
tissue flows at the head--trunk boundary are disrupted, and the expansion
caused by mitotic domains combined with the compression caused by the germ band
extension increases tissue strain at the head--trunk boundary, which the
outcome is the formation of stochastic ectopic folds of mechanical origin. This
overview allowed us to speculate on the putative developmental role of the
cephalic furrow for gastrulation.

Thus, what the cephalic furrow accomplishes during gastrulation is to
anticipate the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary by priming the
position of a predictable (and genetically-determined fold). The convergent
tissue interactions are directed and buffered by the cephalic furrow
invagination. The cephalic furrow thus prevents the epithelial instability in
an area of potential tissue interactions, and with that potential defects
associated with erratic buckling, such as the compromise of cell-to-cell
interactions or short-range signaling in the epithelia, and thus ensure a
stereotypical balance of forces required for the precise patterning of
embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

<!--Moreover, the germ band extension exerts pressure at the head--trunk boundary, to the extent the epithelium becomes unstable and buckles when the cephalic furrow is absent. This raises the hypothesis that what the cephalic furrow accomplishes during gastrulation is to counteract the pressure from the germ band, by priming the timing and position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia under compression, thus preventing erratic epithelial buckling.-->

<!--## Cephalic furrow morphogenesis requires coordination of genetic and mechanical processes-->

<!--The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 ¬µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.-->

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process. That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process caused by the germ band was not.-->

<!--Overall, our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.-->

<!--## Conclusions-->

<!--Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila. The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.-->
