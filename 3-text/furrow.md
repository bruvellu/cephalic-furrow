# Abstract

The cephalic furrow is a deep epithelial invagination that demarcates the
head--trunk boundary of *Drosophila* during gastrulation. Unlike other
embryonic invaginations, the cephalic furrow is a transient structure that
vanishes without giving rise to any particular tissues. It thus remains unclear
what role this prominent embryonic landmark plays in the embryo. Here we
investigate whether the cephalic furrow plays a physical role in *Drosophila*
embryogenesis. Using live-imaging of mutant embryos we analyze how defects in
cephalic furrow formation impact the tissue interactions during gastrulation.
We find that, in the absence of the cephalic furrow, the head--trunk
interface becomes deformed and forms erratic ectopic folds. We show these folds
are the result of extrinsic forces driven by the formation of mitotic domains
and the extension of the germ band. Thus, in the absence of the cephalic
furrow, the opposing interactions between head and trunk tissues increase the
mechanical stress in the monolayer epithelium. We thus propose that the
cephalic furrow buffers these physical interactions by priming the position of
folding and storing epithelial tissue out-of-plane, preventing epithelial
instability at the head--trunk boundary during gastrulation.

# Background

The head--trunk boundary in the fruit fly *Drosophila melanogaster* is
demarcated by an invagination known as the cephalic furrow. Beginning as
bilateral indentations in the anterior portion of the blastoderm, the cephalic
furrow is one of the first morphogenetic movements in the embryo at the onset
of gastrulation. These indentations quickly invaginate deep into the yolk sac,
forming a prominent anatomical landmark that divides the procephalon (posterior
head region) from the germ band (trunk region) [@Hartenstein1985-zs;
@Foe1989-cw]. The position of the cephalic furrow is specified with a
remarkable 1% accuracy of the embryo length [@Liu2013-lc] and depends on the
zygotic expression of *buttonhead* (*btd*) and *even skipped* (*eve*)
[@Vincent1997-fa]. The overlap between *btd* and *eve* specifies a single row
of initiator cells which shorten apicobasally driven by the contractile
activity of lateral myosin [@Eritano2020-mi]. These initiators cells sink below
the basal lamina pulling the surrounding tissues deep into the yolk in a
stereotypic morphogenetic sequence [@Spencer2015-td]. While the tissue
invaginates, the mechanical coupling between epithelial cells ensures the
precision of the fold [@Eritano2020-mi]. Even though the patterning and
morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow remains poorly understood
[@Gilmour2017-um], the available data shows that its formation is under precise
genetic control and that safeguarding mechanisms are in place to ensure the
accuracy of morphogenesis.

Despite such tight control, it is unclear what is the role of the cephalic
furrow in development. Unlike other embryonic invaginations such as the ventral
furrow or midgut invaginations which are associated with mesoderm and endoderm
formation, the cephalic furrow does not give rise to any particular tissue in
the embryo. Even more intriguingly, the cephalic furrow is ephemeral. It
progressively unfolds in a couple of hours after gastrulation without leaving
morphological traces [@Vincent1997-fa]. A variety of roles have been proposed
for the cephalic furrow, such as a mechanical separation of domains etc
[@cfroles]. In silico models suggest the cephalic furrow might act as a barrier
to the tissue flows generated by the germ band extension during gastrulation
[@Dicko2017-wz]. However, the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other
morphogenetic movements have not been investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac],
and the physical role of the cephalic furrow remains unclear.

In this study we investigate whether the cephalic furrow has a mechanical role
during gastrulation by examining how the tissue interactions at the head--trunk
boundary are impacted by defects in cephalic furrow formation. We find that
cephalic furrow mutants show increased strain and ectopic buckling events in
the monolayer epithelium at the head--trunk interface. We show this epithelial
instability is the result of extrinsic forces and is caused by the simultaneous
expansion of mitotic domains in the head, and the extension of the germ band in
the trunk. Our data suggests that the role of the cephalic furrow in normal
development is to buffer these conflicting interactions by priming the folding
and storing epithelial tissue out-of-plane, and thus preventing mechanical
stress at the head--trunk boundary.

<!--Its transient nature makes the cephalic furrow particularly challenging to investigate, and partly the reason why only a few mutants have been identified. -->

<!--Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--Interestingly, in *eve* embryos where the cephalic furrow fails to invaginate, a late fold appears in the cephalic region [@Vincent1997-fa]. The origin of this late fold is unclear whether it is a reminiscent of the cephalic furrow patterning or formed by other developmental mechanisms. Thus, the physical role in the global dynamics of *Drosophila* gastrulation remains poorly understood.-->

<!--This process remains poorly known [@Gilmour2017-um; @Vincent1997-fa].-->

<!--Mutants for either *btd* or *eve* fail to initiate the cephalic furrow [@Vincent1997-fa]. -->

<!--a patterning that can be achieved with only four genes [@Dubuis2013-jf]-->

<!--The main genes associated with cephalic furrow development are *buttonhead* (*btd*), *even skipped* (*eve*), and *paired* (*prd*). In *btd* and *eve* embryos the cephalic furrow fails to initiate the process of invagination [@Vincent1997-fa], while in *prd* embryos the cephalic furrow formation is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. However, it remains unclear how the absence or delay in cephalic furrow formation impacts the local tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--Cephalic furrow is genetically-defined with a precise stereotypic timing and position. The invagination is large extending from dorsal to ventral and deep sinking almost the whole yolk invagination at an important anatomical landmark of the embryo, the head--trunk boundary. Yet, the cephalic furrow, unlike the ventral furrow, does not give rise to a particular cell fates and is transient, this massive structure progressively unfolds before germ band retraction. These features, being a major but transient structure make the cephalic furrow one of the most enigmatic morphogenetic movements in *Drosophila* gastrulation (@fig:headtrunk).-->

<!--Cephalic furrow directs convergent tissue flow preventing epithelial deformations at the head--trunk boundary.-->

<!--We find that embryos that fail to initiate the cephalic furrow form late ectopic folds at the head--trunk interface. These ectopic folds differ from the cephalic furrow in timing, formation dynamics, folded area, and morphology. The number and position of ectopic folds across the anteroposterior axis varies between individual mutant embryos. We show the timing and position of ectopic folds correlates with the formation of mitotic domains, suggesting that local tissue interactions are causing the tissue to buckle. These local interactions, however, are not sufficient to generate ectopic folds. Using laser cauterizations to mechanically block the germ band extension, we show the occurrence of ectopic folds at the head--trunk boundary depends on the global tissue compression caused by the germ band extension, and that this interaction also contributes to the cephalic furrow formation in normal embryogenesis.-->

# Results

To gain insight into the role of the cephalic furrow during gastrulation, we
analyzed the head-trunk boundary---where the cephalic furrow is formed in
normal development---in mutants that lack this invagination. For this, we
generated fluorescent fly lines with loss-of-function alleles of genes known to
play a role in cephalic furrow formation, and imaged the embryos *in toto*
under high-temporal resolution using lightsheet microscopy.

<!--We generated flies containing loss-of-function alleles known to disrupt cephalic furrow formation [*btd^XA^* and *eve^3^*, @Vincent1997-fa] and a fluorescent membrane marker [GAP43-mCherry, @Martin2010-pb].-->

We first analyzed the epithelial dynamics in *btd* and *eve* mutants. In normal
development, these two genes specify the row of initiator cells that drive the
invagination of the cephalic furrow [@Vincent1997-fa]. When *btd* or *eve*
function is knocked down, the initiator cells do not invaginate and,
consequently, the cephalic furrow fails form [@Vincent1997-fa]. In heterozygote
embryos for the *btd* or *eve* loss-of-function alleles (i.e. sibling
controls[^siblings]), the cephalic furrow initiates at the onset of
cellularization, invaginates for 15 min, and begins to unfold around 30 min
after gastrulation ({@fig:ectopic}A). In homozygote embryos for the *btd* or
*eve* alleles (i.e. mutants), the cephalic furrow fails to initiate and no
invagination is visible in the lateral surface of stages 6 and 7a
({@fig:ectopic}A). In the subsequent stages 7b and 8, however, we observe the
formation of epithelial folds at the head--trunk interface of both *btd* and
*eve* mutant embryos ({@fig:ectopic}A, Videos 1 and 2). These folds, from now
on referred as ectopic folds, appear simultaneously with the mitotic domains,
and reach their fullest extension in stage 8. They have, however, an even
shorter existence than the cephalic furrow, folding and unfolding entirely in
about 20 min ({@fig:ectopic}A).

[^siblings]: Comparison to wild type will probably be needed.

<!--The presence of ectopic folds in both *btd* and *eve* raised the possibility that this phenotype is associated with the absence of the cephalic furrow in these embryos. We thus characterize the distribution and dynamics of ectopic fold formation to understand the processes causing the head--trunk tissue to fold in cephalic furrow mutants.-->

<!--We manually traced individual folds and extracted tortuosity measurements, angle displacement, folded area, and location along the anteroposterior axis.-->

To understand the origin of the ectopic folds forming in the absence of the
cephalic furrow, we analysed their morphology and distribution, and
characterized their dynamics throughout development. We find that *btd* and
*eve* mutant embryos invariably form between one and four ectopic folds on each
side of the body (Table 1, {@fig:dynamics}A,D). The ectopic folds form by an
abrupt epithelial buckling, instead of progressive invagination as it occurs
with the cephalic furrow ({@fig:dynamics}B), and lack the stereotypic cell
morphologies present in the cephalic furrow, such as wedge-shaped initiator
cells. Furthermore, the ectopic folds have a wider and often asymmetric cleft
({@fig:dynamics}A, Video 3 and 4), and are about 25% shorter than the cephalic
furrow of sibling controls ({@fig:dynamics}C). This shallower depth is
reflected in the total epithelial area contained within ectopic folds, which is
about half of the area contained within the cephalic furrow invagination in
sibling controls ({@fig:dynamics}H,I). Unlike the predictable positioning of
the cephalic furrow in normal development, the position of ectopic folds varies
between individual mutant embryos and they can form either anterior or
posterior of the head--trunk boundary ({@fig:dynamics}E). Finally, we also
observe differences in the shape dynamics between the cephalic furrow and
ectopic folds. While the former progressively tilts posteriorly during the
first 15 min after gastrulation, which is accompanied by a smooth bending of
the fold outline, the latter forms already tilted and shows variable shapes
with no particular trend in time ({@fig:dynamics}F--I). Overall, these analyses
reveal that the characteristics of ectopic folds not only differ significantly
from the cephalic furrow, but that their shape, dynamics and position is more
variable. This suggests that ectopic fold formation might be driven by
extrinsic mechanical forces acting in the monolayer epithelium rather than by
intrinsic mechanisms under the genetic control.

<!--TODO: Include tortuosity of dorsal views-->

<!--it can even differ between the left and right side of the same embryo ({@fig:dynamics}H).-->

<!--We identified a difference between *btd* and *eve* embryos. While *eve* mutants show no initiator cell behavior, we observe cell shape changes in *btd* mutants that are reminiscent of initiator cell behaviors ({@fig:dynamics}B).-->

Despite being variable, the distribution of ectopic folds along the head--trunk
interface correlates with the position of mitotic domains---groups of
blastoderm cells that divide in synchrony during mitotic cycle 14
[@Foe1989-cw]. Our analysis show that ectopic folds often form adjacent to or
in between mitotic domains ({@fig:mitotic}B,C). We identify four distinct
locations for ectopic fold formation, either anterior or posterior to the
canonical cephalic furrow position. In *btd* embryos they can form between MD1
and MD9/MD5, between MD5 and MD7, between MD7 and MD6, and posterior to MD6
({@fig:mitotic}B). In *eve* embryos a similar folding pattern is present except
for the lack of ectopic folds between MD7 and MD6. The formation of ectopic
folds coincides, not only spatially, but also temporally with mitotic domains.
We observe that the simultaneous expansion in the apical area of dividing cells
always precedes the formation of ectopic folds. During mitotic rounding, the
dividing cells are displaced apically in the epithelium and compress the
non-dividing cells, which in turn expand basally ({@fig:mitotic}B). The
buckling initiates within the area of compressed non-dividing cells, but a
portion of the area of the mitotic domains also fold inwards ({@fig:mitotic}B).
Unlike the cephalic furrow invagination, the buckling of ectopic folds occurs
abruptly with the expansion of mitotic domains (Video 6). These observations
indicate that local forces generated by the expansion of mitotic domains might
induce the formation of ectopic folds in *btd* and *eve* mutants.

<!--TODO: Include PIV stress analysis by Marina-->

<!--The difference can be related to the fact that *btd* embryos lack MD2 [@Edgar1994-pi] while *eve* mutants have an expanded MD2 [@Vincent1997-fa].-->

To test whether the mitotic domains are required for the formation of ectopic
folds in cephalic furrow mutants, we generated __[ double-mutant flies carrying
the loss of function alleles for *btd* or *eve* and a loss of function allele
for *stg* ]__[^double], a gene that regulates the formation of mitotic domains
in cycle 14 [@Edgar1989-hv]. In this manner, homozygote embryos to both *btd*
and *stg* alleles (or *eve* and *stg*) lack both the cephalic furrow and the
mitotic domains. __[ The double-mutant embryos *still form* ectopic
folds ]__[^hypo] ({@fig:mitotic}C). Therefore, although mitotic domains might
prone the position of folding events along the epithelia, they are not the sole
drivers for the formation of ectopic folds, suggesting that other extrinsic
forces are involved.

[^double]: Replace by the dsRNA experiments which might be ready sooner.

[^hypo]: This is a hypothetical result, the data is not ready yet.

<!--Our observations led us to consider the germ band as the putative driver for the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants.-->

A key driver of tissue movements during gastrulation is the germ band extension
[@citegermband]. The elongating germ band is a source of mechanical pressure on
the tissues of the dorsal region [@gbpressure] ({@fig:mitotic}D)[^headflow]. We
observe that the epithelial cells in this region are more compressed in mutants
compared to the sibling controls ({@fig:mitotic}E), suggesting that in the
absence of the cephalic furrow, these tissues are under greater mechanical
stress generated by the germ band extension. To test if the extension of the
germ band is required for the formation of ectopic folds, we mechanically
blocked the germ band extension in *btd* and *eve* mutants by cauterizing the
epithelial tissue to the vitelline envelope at the onset of gastrulation
({@fig:cauterization}A). Surprisingly, when the germ band extension is blocked
in *btd* or *eve* mutants, no ectopic folds form in the head--trunk epithelia
({@fig:cauterization}B, Video 7,8). Mitotic domains are still present, and
still compress non-dividing cells, but their expansion does not lead to ectopic
folds ({@fig:cauterization}B,C). The monolayer epithelium of cauterized mutants
shows less deformations after gastrulation when compared to non-cauterized
mutants ({@fig:cauterization}D--F). These experiments reveal that the local
forces generated by the mitotic domains alone are insufficient to cause the
tissue to buckle, and that instead, the major driving force for the formation
of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants is the compression of trunk tissues
caused by the elongating germ band[^conco]. 

[^headflow]: Include figure with tissue flows and/or citation.

[^conco]: There is the possibility that the germ band alone is not the main
driver and that both mitotic domains and germ band concomitantly are required
to induce the formation of ectopic folds. This will be the case if no ectopic
folds are observed in the double-mutants or stg RNAi experiments.

<!--TODO: Re-insert prd phenotype here?-->

To complement our *in vivo* observations and uncover the interplay of forces
between mitotic domains and the germ band, we modeled the physical interactions
occurring in the monolayer epithelium of the head--trunk boundary in cephalic
furrow mutants using a 1D representation. We first analyzed how the tissue
strain caused by the expansion of mitotic domains affects the probability of
folding events in the epithelium. Our simulations reveal that when the
expansion is greater than 1.25 times, the probability of folding is increased
({@fig:model}). The folds occur mostly at the edges of the mitotic domains with
a portion of “dividing cells” also folding inwards, a pattern that we also
observe *in vivo* ({@fig:model} and {@fig:mitotic}B). We next tested how the
distance between adjacent mitotic domains interferes with the folding patterns.
The simulations show that below a critical distance of separation, the
probability of folding between mitotic domains increases significantly, but
when mitotic domains are too close, the folding events are inhibited
({@fig:model}). Moreover, a folding event decreases the probability of other
folds forming in the neighborhood. This inhibitory effect is evident when we
introduce a region with a negative intrinsic curvature parameter to simulate
the invagination of the cephalic furrow. The presence of a “cephalic furrow”
greatly decreases the probability of folds originating from nearby mitotic
domains, especially in simulations where we include a delay in the formation of
mitotic domains to match the timing of these developmental events *in vivo*
({@fig:model} and {@fig:ectopic}). Finally, we incorporated the germ band
extension in our model by introducing a terminal unidirectional expansion from
the side opposite of the mitotic domains. A parameter sweep shows __[ the
minimal rate of expansion and critic compression threshold required for the
germ band to cause ectopic folds on the head ]__ [^gbmodel] ({@fig:model}). Our
model thus uncovers the principles on how localized expansions in a monolayer
epithelium can induce the formation of folds. It reveals how the buckling
events can interact, and demonstrates the compression exerted by the germ band
is essential for the formation of ectopic folds observed *in vivo* in cephalic
furrow mutants.

[^gbmodel]: This needs to be more specific and fit into the story.

Our modeling also predicts that the germ band extension might contribute
mechanically to the invagination of the cephalic furrow during normal
development[^wtgb]. Although the cephalic furrow clearly initiates autonomously
through the intrinsic forces of initiator cells [@Vincent1997-fa;
@Spencer2015-td; @Eritano2020-mi], the germ band elongation could contribute to
the further increase in depth of the cephalic furrow in later stages, an idea
already suggested by classical morphological works of *Drosophila*
embryogenesis [@Campos-Ortega1997-rd]. To analyze this hypothesis in vivo, we
first determined the region of influence of the cephalic furrow by measuring
the recoil velocity of laser-ablated membranes of epithelial cells anterior and
posterior to the initiator cells, as a proxy for tension in the tissue
({@fig:wtcaut}). We find that the recoil velocity decreases with the distance
and becomes negligible around 40 µm anterior or posterior from the initiator
cells. This indicates that a region 80 µm wide at the head--trunk boundary is
under the active pull of the cephalic furrow at the onset of gastrulation. To
test if the germ band contributes to the further deepening of the cephalic
furrow in later stages, we blocked the extension of the germ band by
cauterization. We observe that the maximum depth of the cephalic furrow
invagination in cauterized embryos is about 10% shallower than non-cauterized
embryos (@fig:wtcaut). These experiments show that in normal development the
autonomous active pull generated by the cephalic furrow in the neighboring
epithelia is the main driver of the invagination, but that the extension of the
germ band accounts for a mild influence in the depth of the invagination.

[^wtgb]: Wild guess here, but a possible connection to the wild type
cauterization experiments.

Taken together, our analyses reveal that the absence of the cephalic furrow
invariably leads to the accumulation of tissue stresses and the formation of
ectopic folds in the head--trunk epithelium. The cephalic furrow anticipates
and buffers these tissue interactions and we propose it accomplishes a
mechanical role during *Drosophila* gastrulation.

<!--TODO: Write-up a closing paragraph for the results-->

<!--Thus, we propose the cephalic furrow anticipates these conflicting tissue interactions by priming the position of folding, generating a predictable invagination that contains part of the epithelia, and therefore buffering the tissue interactions at the head--trunk boundary. Overall, this work contributes to our understanding about the global physical interactions that orchestrate the intricate and fascinating morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation.-->

<!--Some predictions that can be taken from the models: what is the minimum/maximum area that needs to be invaginated so that the germ band does not causes ectopic folds. It suggests how much of the mitotic expansion and extension are needed to create instability in an epithelial monolayer. Finally, it suggests that the germ abnd is also pushing the epithelium in vivo.-->

# Discussion

The cephalic furrow remains one of the least understood morphogenetic movements
of *Drosophila* gastrulation [@Gilmour2017-um]. In silico numerical approaches
raised th hypothesis that the cephalic furrow might play a global role in the
complex morphogenetic movements of *Drosophila* gastrulation [@Allena2012-pb;
@Dicko2017-wz]. One hypothesis is that the cephalic furrow act as a barrier for
the entire embryo, orienting the germ band extension towards the posterior
[@Dicko2017-wz]. However, this had not been investigated in vivo.

<!--Our work provides evidence that the cephalic furrow has a mechanical role during gastrulation.-->

<!--TODO: Incorporate somewhere the paragraph below-->

<!--Our in vivo data shows that the absence of the cephalic furrow does not affect the orientation of tissue flows at the posterior end, but that the significant area of epithelial that remains on the surface increases the mechanical stress at the head--trunk boundary. These insights allow us to speculate about putative physical role for the cephalic furrow during gastrulation.-->

By analyzing cephalic furrow mutants under live-imaging, we find that the main
consequence of the lack of the cephalic furrow is the formation of ectopic
folds at the head--trunk interface. The formation of a late ectopic fold near
the cephalic furrow position was previously described in *eve* mutants
[@Vincent1997-fa]. Only recently they have been noted in *btd* mutants [see
Figure S5B in @Eritano2020-mi], even though they are present in previous images
of *btd* embryos [see Figure 8F in @Blankenship2001-tm]. Although it was noted
that these ectopic folds were not being formed through the cephalic furrow
patterning, it was not clear that these ectopic folds were formed as a direct
consequence of the absence of the cephalic furrow, and which are the
developmental processes driving ectopic fold formation. Here we provide
evidence that ectopic folds form as a direct consequence of cephalic furrow
absence and as the result of extrinsic mechanical forces acting at the
head--trunk boundary.

Epithelial folding often involves a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic
forces [@Denk-Lobnig2020-pr]. External stresses such as compressive forces can
generate mechanical instability in the tissue and lead to the formation of
epithelial folds [@Nelson2016-gz; @Collinet2021-qa]. We show there are at least
two key extrinsic forces involved in the formation of these ectopic folds, the
mitotic domain expansions and the germ band extension. Cell division events are
known to alter the local properties of epithelial monolayers when dividing
cells generate outward forces and local stresses [@Gupta2021-oo]. Mitotic cell
rounding have been shown to induce epithelial invagination in the tracheal
placode of *Drosophila* [@Kondo2013-gy], as well as in murine intestine villi
[@Freddo2016-et]. Interestingly, in both cases an intraepithelial compressive
force is required for the generation of an invagination during mitotic
rounding. Our in vivo data and in silico simulations suggest that a similar
situation occurs at the head--trunk boundary epithelium. Without an external
compressive force acting on the epithelial cells such as the germ band, as
evidenced by cauterized cephalic furrow mutants, the expansion of mitotic
domains are unable to cause buckling. Thus, although the expansion of mitotic
domains generate areas prone to buckling, it is ultimately the compression from
the extending germ band that drives the formation of ectopic folds in cephalic
furrow mutants, revealing an unexpected long-range tissue interaction between
the germ band and the head--trunk boundary.

In fact, the simultaneous expansion of mitotic domains in the head and the
extension of the germ band from the trunk generate a convergent zone of tissue
interactions seem to make the folding at the head--trunk interface inevitable
without the presence of the cephalic furrow. Thus, our work suggests that the
cephalic furrow in *Drosophila* act as a buffer to the tissue interactions at
the head--trunk boundary. Under genetic control, the cephalic furrow primes the
position of folding, generating a single predictable fold that directs the
convergent tissue flows from the head and from the trunk, and transiently
stores epithelial tissue out-of-plane. By anticipating the potential mechanical
stress in the monolayer epithelium, the cephalic furrow thus prevents tissue
instability, and the potential downsides associated with erratic buckling, such
as disruptions in cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling. The
evolution of the cephalic furrow, thus, might have provided a stress-free
solution for tissue flows during gastrulation. Further comparative work in
insect development has the potential to clarify the evolutionary context for
the evolution of the cephalic furrow and reveal a glimpse of the complex
mechanical underpinnings of gastrulation dynamics around the head--trunk
boundary of bilaterians.

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow has a physical role that counteracts the tissue-wide stresses generated by the mitotic domains and germ band extension during gastrulation.-->

<!--It remains unclear, however, what led to the evolution of cephalic furrow in the first place and the traits associated with it.-->

<!--The putative role of the cephalic furrow as buffer raises the hypothesis that it evolved to solve a mechanical problem in the embryo, the fact that head and trunk tissues inevitably collide due to the evolution of the germ band extension. Therefore, our data reveals a case suggesting that mechanical forces in the embryo might be drivers for morphological evolution and might explain some of the diversity of shapes and forms in early embryos inside shells which are not subject to external natural selection. -->

<!--Previous observations suggest that force imbalance between mitotic domains play a role in tissue buckling [@Ko2020-wk].-->

<!--These experiments indicate that neither the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, nor the compression of head tissues driven by the germ band extension alone are sufficient to cause the epithelium to buckle. But when both processes occur concomitantly, the blastoderm will inevitably buckle.-->

<!--Recent works show how interactions of the embryonic tissues with the shell [@Munster;@Bailles] and between gastrulation movements [@Guo2021] are important to development.-->

<!--However, the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements have not been investigated *in vivo* [@Kong2017-ac].-->

<!--Our work reveals the cephalic furrow formation is mostly driven by intrinsic forces, but that extrinsic forces also play a minor role suggesting a potential interaction between the germ band and cephalic furrow. -->

<!--We show that it buffers the mechanical stress generated by the germ band extension at the head--trunk boundary, and thus prevents instability of the monolayer epithelium within the complex tissue morphogenesis of *Drosophila*.-->

<!--Global interactions between morphogenetic movements-->

<!--Bottomline is that given MD and GB, the tissue is fated to fold-->

<!--CF ensures it will fold nicely and reproducibly-->

<!--The mechanical interactions during gastrulation seem to make the folding at the head--trunk interface inevitable. This might partly explain why so few cephalic furrow mutants have been identified. Because even though the cephalic furrow is disrupted, it will still fold, though more irregular. Our data on prd and gt embryos supports that because the phenotype which is described as a late fold in fact is a disrupted cephalic furrow that only buckles with the appearance of mitotic domains. -->

<!--The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40 µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments. The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.-->

<!--Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process. That is why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process caused by the germ band was not.-->

<!--Why is that mitotic domains occur in patches rather than synchronized as the previous cycles? One possibility is that mitotic domains can interfere with with morphogenetic movements. Therefore, it would not work if all cells would divide at the same time while the tissue tries to fold and invaginate. Breaking up the mitotic divisions in limited patches is probably good for simultaneous. Since the head has almost no movements, there are a lot of domains there. -->

<!--Overall, our data reveals the morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow is a two-step composite process integrating an active, genetically-defined process of invagination, and a passive tissue buckling driven by the germ band extension, and reveals global physical interactions that contribute to orchestrate the morphogenetic movements of Drosophila gastrulation.-->

<!--Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila. The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation. Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.-->

btd heterozygote (control), a btd homozygote, and an eve homozygote showing the
late formation of ectopic folds around 35--45% germ band extension after the
appearance of mitotic domains. (B) Profile views of control, btd and eve
embryos showing the morphology of the ectopic folds compared to the cephalic
furrow. (C) Illustration showing the timing of developmental events in wild
type compared to cephalic furrow mutants. (D) Length of cephalic furrow
compared to ectopic folds in btd and eve embryos. Arrows indicate the cephalic
furrow. Arrowheads indicate ectopic folds. Asterisks indicate the position of
mitotic domains. Developmental staging based on
