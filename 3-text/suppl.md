## The cephalic furrow invagination is disrupted in weak phenotypes

The cephalic furrow of prd mutants is delayed but forms at the expected
position in the body axis that matches the eve stripe 1 [@prdpaper]. We
analyzed cell and tissue behaviors in prd mutants. We found that initiator cell
behavior is present, timely and possibly expanded. However, the process of
cephalic furrow invagination does not progress normally. The tissue halts
midway only to buckle abruptly when the mitotic domains appear. Despite the
similar outcome, a cephalic epithelial fold, we note that this fold is not
formed through the usual process of invagination (which is disrupted). We
observe a similar phenomenon in gt mutants.

## btd mutants show initiator cell behaviors

<!--Initiator cell behavior in btd mutant-->

We analyzed the cellular behaviors in cephalic furrow mutants. While eve
mutants show no initiator cell behaviors, we observe reminiscent cell shape
changes in btd mutants. In wild type embryos, the apices of initiator cell are
tightly coupled to the apices of adjacent cells when they begin shortening
(@fig:reminiscent-initiators). The adjacent and neighbor cells form a small
epithelial indentation below the vitelline envelope. The width of this
indentation remains roughly the same during the cephalic furrow invagination.
The cells that sink into the invagination converge at this indentation point.

In btd mutants, known for not having a furrow, show a reminiscent behavior
previously undescribed. btd embryos do not show the tight apical connection
between initiators and adjacent cells, but it does show an epithelial
indentation (@fig:reminiscent-initiators). This indentation is delayed and
wider in relation to the wild type morphogenesis. While the cells shorten in
height, the indentation widens with cells detaching from the vitelline
envelope. Until the two sides of the invagination collapse together and mitotic
divisions occur in the invaginated cells.

<!--TODO: Measure the width of the indentation across time.-->

<!--These data indicates that cell behaviors that occur in wild type cephalic furrow formation are still occurring in btd mutants. This suggests the molecular patterning of surrounding cells are still occurring independent of btd, and that the initiator cell behavior is a coordinated composite of cellular behaviors.-->

<!--TODO: Cell shape changes in btd mutant-->

We observe cell shape changes as well. The live-imaging data revealed that btd
mutants exhibit reminiscent initiator cell behaviors at the head-trunk
interface which occur before any of the tissue flows. After the tissue flows,
we see a range of cell shape changes with compression on both sides and a
shearing effect at the boundary.

## Cauterization of initiator cells to block the cephalic furrow

**Supplementary:** *Blocking the cephalic furrow in wild type causes ectopic
buckling.* If an excess of epithelia in association with mitotic domains and
germ band compression, we expect that by blocking the cephalic furrow, we would
find ectopic folding occurring in the epithelia. We blocked the cephalic furrow
invagination by cauterizing the row of initiator cells. We find the prediction
holds.
