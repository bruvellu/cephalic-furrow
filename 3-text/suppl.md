## The cephalic furrow invagination is disrupted in weak phenotypes

The cephalic furrow of prd mutants is delayed but forms at the expected
position in the body axis that matches the eve stripe 1 [@prdpaper]. We
analyzed cell and tissue behaviors in prd mutants. We found that initiator cell
behavior is present, timely and possibly expanded. However, the process of
cephalic furrow invagination does not progress normally. The tissue halts
midway only to buckle abruptly when the mitotic domains appear. Despite the
similar outcome, a cephalic epithelial fold, we note that this fold is not
formed through the usual process of invagination (which is disrupted). We
observe a similar phenomenon in gt mutants.

## Cephalic furrow directs flow in tissue shear zone of the head-trunk boundary

<!--TODO: Tissue flow in btd and eve mutants-->

We analyzed the tissue flows and cell shape changes in mutants that fail to
initiate the cephalic furrow. We observe opposite tissue flows from the head
and trunk with a clear boundary region characterized by cells with low
circularity and greater distance to neighbors.

<!--TODO: Figure with laser ablations around the cephalic furrow area-->

Cephalic furrow invagination actively increases tissue tension. Using laser
ablations near the initiator cells we identified that there is an increase in
tension in an area of about 40 µm anterior and posterior.

## btd mutants show initiator cell behaviors

<!--Initiator cell behavior in btd mutant-->

We analyzed the cellular behaviors in cephalic furrow mutants. While eve
mutants show no initiator cell behaviors, we observe reminiscent cell shape
changes in btd mutants. In wild type embryos, the apices of initiator cell are
tightly coupled to the apices of adjacent cells when they begin shortening
(@fig:reminiscent-initiators). The adjacent and neighbor cells form a small
epithelial indentation below the vitelline envelope. The width of this
indentation remains roughly the same during the cephalic furrow invagination.
The cells that sink into the invagination converge at this indentation point.

In btd mutants, known for not having a furrow, show a reminiscent behavior
previously undescribed. btd embryos do not show the tight apical connection
between initiators and adjacent cells, but it does show an epithelial
indentation (@fig:reminiscent-initiators). This indentation is delayed and
wider in relation to the wild type morphogenesis. While the cells shorten in
height, the indentation widens with cells detaching from the vitelline
envelope. Until the two sides of the invagination collapse together and mitotic
divisions occur in the invaginated cells.

<!--TODO: Measure the width of the indentation across time.-->

<!--These data indicates that cell behaviors that occur in wild type cephalic furrow formation are still occurring in btd mutants. This suggests the molecular patterning of surrounding cells are still occurring independent of btd, and that the initiator cell behavior is a coordinated composite of cellular behaviors.-->

<!--TODO: Cell shape changes in btd mutant-->

We observe cell shape changes as well. The live-imaging data revealed that btd
mutants exhibit reminiscent initiator cell behaviors at the head-trunk
interface which occur before any of the tissue flows. After the tissue flows,
we see a range of cell shape changes with compression on both sides and a
shearing effect at the boundary.

## prd is a key cephalic furrow gene

In addition, we analyzed *prd* embryos where the formation of the cephalic furrow is delayed [@Blankenship2001-tm]. Although *prd* embryos seem to form a cephalic furrow at the expected position, our live imaging reveals the process of invagination initiates but halts mid way through (Figure X). Analyses of the dynamics and area of folded tissue shows the folding is *prd* embryos is more similar to the ectopic folds than to the cephalic furrow invagination (Figure X). This suggests the lack of *prd* activity is more important to the patterning of the cephalic furrow than previously thought.

## Cauterization of initiator cells to block the cephalic furrow

**Supplementary:** *Blocking the cephalic furrow in wild type causes ectopic
buckling.* If an excess of epithelia in association with mitotic domains and
germ band compression, we expect that by blocking the cephalic furrow, we would
find ectopic folding occurring in the epithelia. We blocked the cephalic furrow
invagination by cauterizing the row of initiator cells. We find the prediction
holds.

## Active pull drives cephalic furrow invagination during normal embryogenesis with small input from the germ band extension 

<!--TODO: This section would fit better in a paper about the interactions of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements. Could this fit into another paper?-->

<!--The messages would be more or less:

1. Range of tissue pulling from CF invagination
2. Interaction with ventral furrow
3. Interaction with germ band
4. Interaction with foregut invagination
5. Interaction with mitotic domains

But then one needs to quantify the effects to VF, GB, FI and MD in cephalic
furrow mutants, and find mutants for each of these and analyze the effects to
the CF.
-->

<!--Mitotic domains and germ band interactions in wild type-->

The finding that the germ band extension interacts with head tissues, led us to
ask whether the invagination of the cephalic furrow in wild type embryogenesis
is also pushed by the germ band elongation. Historical observations already
suggested that mitotic domains and the germ band could contribute to the
cephalic furrow invagination [@Campos-Ortega1997-rd], and a recent work shows
the completion of the ventral furrow depends on the physical push from the
adjacent ectoderm [@Guo2021-sj]. To understand how the germ band extension
interacts with the cephalic furrow formation, we performed laser ablations and
cauterizations in wild type at different locations in the embryo.

<!--Laser ablations in wild type suggest active CF-->

To understand the mechanical properties of the tissues surrounding the cephalic
furrow, we first quantified the force the cephalic furrow creates during the
invagination process using laser ablations. We measured the recoil velocity in
the epithelium anterior and posterior to the cephalic furrow (Figure laser
ablation illustration). We find the recoil velocity of cell membranes decrease
with the distance to the initiator cells (Figure panel laser ablation). The
recoil velocity becomes negligible at a distance of 40 µm from the initiator
cells. This indicates the invagination of the cephalic furrow actively pulls
the epithelial cells at the onset of gastrulation within a region 80 µm wide of
the head--trunk blastoderm.

<!--Analyses of mitotic domain single mutants-->

**[Hypothetical outcome]** We then investigated whether the local expansion
caused by mitotic domains could influence the depth of the cephalic furrow. We
measured the depth of the cephalic furrow in *stg* mutants. We find initial
invagination of the cephalic furrow in *stg* mutants shows no differences in
depth from control embryos. We also observe an anterior shift in the cephalic
furrow position in *stg* embryos. This anterior shift coincides with the
progression of the germ band towards the head region which lacks the expansion
of head tissues due to the absence of mitotic domains.

<!--Cauterization of wild type indicate mild GB to CF depth-->

We then tested whether the force generated by the germ band extension
contributes to the cephalic furrow invagination. We blocked the germ band
elongation in wild type embryos using our cauterization approach and measured
the depth of the cephalic furrow invagination. We find the cephalic furrow in
cauterized embryos is about 10% shallower than non-cauterized embryos
(@fig:wildcauts). This indicates a mild influence of the germ band extension in
the process of cephalic furrow invagination.

<!--GB influence in the position and dynamics of CF-->

The cauterization, however, has consequences to the dynamics and position of
the cephalic furrow. We observe that in cauterized embryos there is a posterior
shift in the dorsal portion of the cephalic furrow (@fig:wildcauts). This
posterior shift occurs with expansion of head tissues associated with the
initiation of mitotic domains. In non-cauterized embryos, the dorsal shift of
the cephalic furrow is contained by the expansion of the germ band. Despite not
having a significant effect in the depth of the cephalic furrow, the tissue
interactions at the dorsal portion of the embryo are influenced by the germ
band extension.

<!--Curiously, if the cauterization is unequal, the depth of the cephalic furrow on the left and right side are different. -->

<!--Cephalic furrow is mostly autonomous but interactions matter-->

Overall, these results show that in normal embryogenesis the morphogenesis of
the cephalic is mainly driven by itself, specified and mediated genetically and
autonomously, with the mitotic domains and germ band extension contributing a
minor role in pushing the cephalic furrow. However, we observe that when the
mitotic domains are absent, or the germ band extension is blocked, the tissue
dynamics at the head--trunk boundary are affected. We thus suggest the cephalic
furrow morphogenesis is largely governed by the orchestration of genetic
patterning with a minor role of the mechanical forces in the embryo.
