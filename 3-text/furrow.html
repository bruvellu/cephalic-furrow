<h1 id="abstract">Abstract</h1>
<p>The cephalic furrow is a deep epithelial fold that demarcates the
head–trunk boundary of fly embryos during gastrulation. It forms by
active cellular mechanisms following an invariant morphogenetic sequence
under strict genetic control. But unlike other embryonic invaginations,
the cephalic furrow is transient and the invaginated cells do not give
rise to any precursor tissues or larval structures. The cephalic furrow
unfolds leaving no trace, and its function in development has remained
elusive. Here we show that the cephalic furrow plays a mechanical role
during <em>Drosophila</em> gastrulation. By live-imaging mutant embryos,
we find that without the cephalic furrow, ectopic folds appear around
the head–trunk interface indicating that the epithelial stability has
been compromised. Using <em>in vivo</em> perturbations and <em>in
silico</em> simulations, we demonstrate that ectopic folding in cephalic
furrow mutants occurs due to the concomitant formation of mitotic
domains and the extension of the germ band which increase the tissue
strain in the head–trunk interface giving rise to mechanical
instabilities. Further, we show by simulations that an early
pre-patterned invagination can effectively prevent the build up of
compressive stresses by retaining a portion of the epithelial monolayer
folded out-of-plane before other morphogenetic movements take place. Our
findings suggest the cephalic furrow absorbs compressive stresses at the
head–trunk boundary during fly gastrulation, and raise the hypothesis
that mechanical forces may have played a role in the evolution of the
cephalic furrow.</p>
<!--TODO:AB: Because we don’t have force measurements, we may want to stick with strain. The idea is to say that the CF alleviates tissue strain because we can measure it directly, and only use this as evidence that the CF absorbs compressive stresses because we don’t have force measurements.-->

In pre-patterned invaginations, the position and timing of folding is
tightly regulated by genes which instruct active cell shape changes
driving morphogenesis<span class="citation"
data-cites="Collinet2021-qa"><sup><a href="#ref-Collinet2021-qa"
role="doc-biblioref">3</a></sup></span>. In fly embryos, the epithelial
invaginations that form during gastrulation are pre-patterned and
usually fulfill a clear role in development: giving rise to precursor
tissues. The ventral furrow and the midgut invaginations, for instance,
give rise to the mesoderm and to the endoderm of the flies,
respectively. One exception to this pattern is a prominent head
invagination present in flies, known as the cephalic furrow.</p>
<p>The formation of the cephalic furrow is one of the earliest events in
<em>Drosophila</em> gastrulation. It first appears as a lateral
indentation which quickly invaginates and forms a deep epithelial fold
at the boundary between head (procephalon) and trunk (germ band)<span

href="#ref-Spencer2015-td" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>.
Similar to other embryonic invaginations, the formation of the cephalic
furrow is under strict genetic control and follows a stereotypic
morphogenetic sequence of events. The site of invagination is determined
by the zygotic expression of two transcription factors,
<em>buttonhead</em> (<em>btd</em>) and <em>even skipped</em>
(<em>eve</em>), whose domains overlap at the head–trunk boundary by a
narrow row of blastoderm cells<span class="citation"
data-cites="Vincent1997-fa"><sup><a href="#ref-Vincent1997-fa"
role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>. These so-called initiator cells
shorten along the apical–basal axis by activating lateral myosin

href="#ref-Foe1989-cw" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>. This
prominent fold, however, is only transient. A couple of hours after
gastrulation, the cephalic furrow unfolds and disappears leaving no
trace, and the invaginated tissue does not give rise to any specific
precursors or larval structures<span class="citation"
data-cites="Hartenstein1985-zs"><sup><a href="#ref-Hartenstein1985-zs"
role="doc-biblioref">4</a></sup></span>. The cephalic furrow is,
therefore, a puzzling structure; it is a prominent fold forming at a
crucial stage of development, has a finely regulated morphogenesis
driven by active cellular mechanisms, but vanishes without any obvious
function for the embryo.</p>
<p>This ephemeral nature and absence of associated fates suggests the
cephalic furrow may play a more immediate, physical role during
gastrulation. Some hypotheses are that the invagination functions as a
temporary storage of anterior cells until later in development<span
class="citation" data-cites="Turner1977-ol"><sup><a

class="citation" data-cites="Stern2021-zv"><sup><a

<p>Our work investigates the physical consequences of perturbing the
formation of the cephalic furrow in <em>Drosophila</em>. To comprehend
the impact of cephalic furrow defects, we generated fluorescent lines
carrying a membrane marker and a loss of function allele for genes known
to affect cephalic furrow formation—<em>btd</em>, <em>eve</em>, and
<em>paired</em> (<em>prd</em>)<span class="citation"
data-cites="Vincent1997-fa Blankenship2001-tm"><sup><a
href="#ref-Vincent1997-fa" role="doc-biblioref">7</a>,<a
href="#ref-Blankenship2001-tm" role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span>.
In <em>prd</em> mutants, the formation of the cephalic furrow is delayed
relative to wildtype embryos<span class="citation"
data-cites="Blankenship2001-tm"><sup><a href="#ref-Blankenship2001-tm"
role="doc-biblioref">14</a></sup></span>, while in <em>btd</em> and
<em>eve</em> mutants, the cephalic furrow is absent<span
class="citation" data-cites="Vincent1997-fa"><sup><a
href="#ref-Vincent1997-fa" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>. To
capture the tissue dynamics during gastrulation and the relative timing
of developmental events, we imaged these mutant embryos using lightsheet
microscopy <em>in toto</em> and with high temporal resolution.</p>
<p>Our recordings show differences between the three mutants at the
cellular and tissue levels (Figure <a href="#fig:ectopic">1</a>a). In
wildtype embryos, the initiator cells undergo cell shortening and
anisotropic apical constriction at the end of cellularization<span
class="citation" data-cites="Spencer2015-td"><sup><a
href="#ref-Spencer2015-td" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>
(Figure <a href="#fig:initiator">S1</a>a,b). These behaviors are delayed
but still present in <em>prd</em> mutants. The initiator cells in
<em>prd</em> mutants lack the typical arched profile of the wildtype
initiators, but they shorten and apically constrict forming a clear
infolding point in the epithelium about six minutes after gastrulation
(Figure <a href="#fig:initiator">S1</a>a,b). The putative initiator
cells of <em>btd</em> mutants do not shorten, but show a reminiscent
degree of apical constriction which creates a small indentation in
epithelium of some embryos (Figure <a href="#fig:initiator">S1</a>a,b,
<a href="#fig:vid-initiator">Video S1</a>). In contrast, <em>eve</em>
mutants show neither apical constriction nor cell shortening and the
epithelium remains flat until about ten minutes after gastrulation
(Figure <a href="#fig:initiator">S1</a>a,b). While the behavior of
initiator cells is perturbed in the three mutants, it is only in
<em>btd</em> and <em>eve</em> that the cellular basis for cephalic
furrow formation—the cell shortening—is severely disrupted. Strikingly,
about 10–15 min after the onset of gastrulation, these mutants form a
notable epithelial fold near the canonical position of cephalic furrow
formation (Figure <a href="#fig:initiator">S1</a>a). Intrigued by this
puzzling phenotype, we asked whether the formation of this late fold is
a direct consequence of the absence of the cephalic furrow.</p>
<!--These differences may be associated with apical myosin activity which is present in *btd* but not in *eve* mutants [@Eritano2020-mi].-->
<!--TODO: Create video for btd initiator cells {!@fig:vid-initiator-btd}-->
<!--TODO: Create video for prd initiator cells {!@fig:vid-initiator-prd}-->
<p>The appearance of a late fold was first noted in <em>eve</em>
mutants<span class="citation" data-cites="Vincent1997-fa"><sup><a
href="#ref-Vincent1997-fa" role="doc-biblioref">7</a></sup></span>, and
only more recently observed in <em>btd</em> mutants<span
class="citation" data-cites="Eritano2020-mi"><sup><a
href="#ref-Eritano2020-mi" role="doc-biblioref">8</a></sup></span>.
However, their significance and the mechanisms driving their formation
have remained unclear. Our recordings show that in all embryos where the
cephalic furrow fails to initiate, ectopic folds appear near the
canonical site of cephalic furrow invagination (Figure <a
href="#fig:ectopic">1</a>a,b,c, <a href="#fig:vid-lateral-btd">Video
1</a>, <a href="#fig:vid-lateral-eve">Video 2</a>). They appear 15 min
after the cephalic furrow would have formed, when the germ band is
extended to around 35% of the egg length (Figure <a
href="#fig:ectopic">1</a>a,c,d, Table <a href="#tbl:gbtime">1</a>), and
then disappear in about 20 min—faster than the wildtype cephalic furrow.
Ectopic folds have a wider and often asymmetric cleft compared to the
cephalic furrow, and lack the typical cell morphologies of the
invagination, such as the wedge-shaped initiator cells and elongated
edge cells<span class="citation" data-cites="Spencer2015-td"><sup><a
href="#ref-Spencer2015-td" role="doc-biblioref">6</a></sup></span>
(Figure <a href="#fig:ectopic">1</a>b, <a
href="#fig:vid-profile-btd">Video 3</a>, <a
href="#fig:vid-profile-eve">Video 4</a>). Unlike the cephalic furrow,
the position of ectopic folds varies between individual mutant embryos
as they can form anterior, posterior, or near the wildtype site of
invagination (Figure <a href="#fig:ectopic">1</a>f, Figure <a
href="#fig:features">S2</a>b, <a href="#fig:vid-dynamics-btd">Video
S2</a>, <a href="#fig:vid-variability-btd">Video S3</a>). Finally,
ectopic folds show more variable kinetics (Figure <a
href="#fig:features">S2</a>d,e), are 25% shallower (Figure <a
href="#fig:features">S2</a>f), and occupy an area 50% smaller compared
to the cephalic furrow (Figure <a href="#fig:ectopic">1</a>g,h,
Figure <a href="#fig:features">S2</a>c). Such differences in morphology
and dynamics suggest that the cephalic furrow and the ectopic folds form
via distinct mechanisms.</p>
<p>To better understand the mechanisms of ectopic folding, we analyzed
the phenomenon more broadly in our datasets and found that ectopic folds
may also occur in embryos with a cephalic furrow (i.e. <em>btd</em> or
<em>eve</em> heterozygotes, <em>prd</em> hetero- or homozygotes, and
wildtype). These ectopic folds, however, differ from the ectopic folds
of cephalic mutants in two key aspects. While the frequency of ectopic
folding is high in cephalic furrow mutants (&gt;93%)—nearly every
<em>btd</em> and <em>eve</em> homozygote shows one or more ectopic folds
per embryo side (2.0±1.0 and 1.8±0.6, respectively) (Figure <a
href="#fig:ectopic">1</a>b, Figure <a href="#fig:features">S2</a>a)—the
frequency of ectopic folding in the other embryos is lower, ranging
between 12% (<em>eve</em> heterozygotes) and 80% (wildtype embryos)
(Table <a href="#tbl:stats">2</a>). In addition, the area of ectopic
folds in wildtype embryos is 3–4x smaller than the area of ectopic folds
in cephalic furrow mutants (Figure <a href="#fig:features">S2</a>g–k,
Table <a href="#tbl:area">3</a>). Thus, cephalic furrow mutants have
more frequent and more prominent ectopic folds compared to wildtype
embryos. These data provide evidence that the absence of the cephalic
furrow is causally linked to an increase in the frequency and in the
magnitude of ectopic folding during <em>Drosophila</em>
gastrulation.</p>
<!--TODO:AB: Quantify the variability of ectopic folds in some way (plot it)-->
<p>The variable positions and frequency of ectopic folding suggests that
they are not under genetic control comparable to that of the cephalic
furrow, but that they may form as a result of physical interactions in
the tissue. We investigated two concurrent gastrulation processes that
could drive their formation: cell divisions in mitotic domains and the
extension of the germ band. Mitotic domains are groups of blastoderm
cells that divide in synchrony during the cleavage cycle 14<span
class="citation" data-cites="Foe1989-cw"><sup><a href="#ref-Foe1989-cw"
role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span>. The first mitotic domains in
<em>Drosophila</em> appear in the head around 20 min after
gastrulation<span class="citation" data-cites="Foe1989-cw"><sup><a
href="#ref-Foe1989-cw" role="doc-biblioref">5</a></sup></span> which
coincides with the formation of ectopic folds (Figure <a
href="#fig:ectopic">1</a>a,c,d). Ectopic folds also always appear in
between or adjacent to mitotic domains (Figure <a
href="#fig:mitotic">2</a>a). The dividing cells synchronously lose their
basal attachment, round up at the apical side, and more than double
(2.3x) their apical area during anaphase elongation (Figure <a
href="#fig:apical">S3</a>). This expansion compresses the adjacent
non-dividing cells which are the first to infold, followed by a portion
of the dividing cells within mitotic domains (Figure <a
href="#fig:mitotic">2</a>b). Mitotic expansions always precede ectopic
folding (Figure <a href="#fig:mitotic">2</a>c, Figure <a
href="#fig:initiator">S1</a>a). Compared to the progressive invagination
of the cephalic furrow (about 14 min), the process of ectopic fold
formation is abrupt (about 4 min) (Figure <a
href="#fig:initiator">S1</a>a, <a href="#fig:vid-mitotic-fold">Video
5</a>). To understand the dynamics of tissue strain, we measured the
rate of tissue deformation (strain rate) at the head–trunk using
particle image velocimetry. We find that <em>btd</em> mutants show a
strain rate 1.3x higher than sibling controls with a peak that coincides
with the maximum expansion of mitotic domains and with the appearance of
the ectopic folds (Figure <a href="#fig:mitotic">2</a>d,e, Figure <a
href="#fig:strain">S4</a>, <a href="#fig:vid-strain-rate">Video 6</a>).
However, for the ectopic folds that often form posterior to the Mitotic
Domain 6 (MD6) (Figure <a href="#fig:mitotic">2</a>a,c), the source of
compression must be different; we hypothesized the germ band is
contributing. Therefore, we have also quantified the strain rate at this
posterior region where the trunk tissue interacts with the tip of the
germ band (trunk–germ). At this trunk–germ interface, the strain rate is
lower than at the head–trunk, but it steadily increases over time
probably driven by the extending germ band (Figure <a
href="#fig:mitotic">2</a>d). The epithelial cells between MD6 and the
germ band tip are indeed more compressed in <em>btd</em> mutants
compared to sibling controls, as inferred from the greater reduction in
their apical area (Figure <a href="#fig:mitotic">2</a>e). Taken
together, these analyses suggest the expansion of mitotic domains, and
the extension of the germ band are potential sources of mechanical
stress to the epithelial monolayer, and that they may be involved in the
formation of ectopic folds by tissue buckling.</p>
<!--TODO:AB: Are there force measurements?-->
<!--TODO: Include cell shape analyses with density et al. around here-->
<!--TODO: Quantify compression of trunk-germ cells in btd mutants-->
<p>To determine the relative contribution of mitotic domains and germ
band as sources of mechanical stress on the head–trunk boundary, we
created a physical model to simulate these tissue mechanics <em>in
silico</em> and performed experimental perturbations to test our
theoretical predictions <em>in vivo</em> (see below).</p>
<p>Our model represents an epithelial monolayer confined inside a rigid
shell. It embodies one side of a frontal slice between the midline and
the dorsal apex of a <em>Drosophila</em> embryo with its typical
morphological proportions (Figure <a href="#fig:model">3</a>a, Figure <a

elliptical arc of equidistant particles connected by springs and
enclosed on one side by a rigid barrier representing the vitelline

(Figure <a href="#fig:model">3</a>c). To simulate the physical
interactions between mitotic domains, germ band, and cephalic furrow, we
defined the mitotic domains as regions of compressed springs which tend
to expand, and the cephalic furrow as a narrow region having an
intrinsic negative curvature predisposing the particles to invaginate
(Figure <a href="#fig:model">3</a>b). The germ band in our model is
defined by the position of the posterior-most particle which is fixed at
different percentages of egg length for each simulation (Figure <a
href="#fig:model">3</a>b). Finally, to run the simulations we added a
ground level of random noise, and iterated the model towards an
equilibrium in the total energy of the system.</p>
<p>We first characterized the general properties of the model. In
simulations where folds begin to form, the bending energy increases
releasing a larger amount of stretching energy which in turn makes the
total energy of the system decrease over the iterations (Figure <a
href="#fig:model">3</a>d). The increase in bending energy coincides with
a rapid deepening of the fold. Once the bending energy reaches a peak,
the fold continues to deepen, though more gradually, but the number of
folds stabilizes and there are rarely changes in the overall folding
patterns (Figure <a href="#fig:model">3</a>d, Figure <a
href="#fig:model-features">S6</a>a). Since folding events are stochastic
and can happen at different iterations across different simulations, and
because we are mainly interested in analyzing the initial position and
dynamics of the folding, we used the peak of bending energy as the
reference point to compare and analyze the simulation results.</p>
<!--TODO: Define L (semi-major axis), g (germ band push), s (embryo length)-->
<!--TODO:AB: Describe overfolding events. Mark them on phase diagram. Discuss as limitation-->
<p>To obtain realistic values where the model matches experimental
observations, we performed a sweep across the bending rigidity parameter
space in mutant conditions without the cephalic furrow. We quantified
the tissue dynamics by measuring the distance of each particle to the
vitelline envelope across iterations, and defined a fold when this
distance was greater than the maximum standard deviation of the average
particle depth under the ground noise levels.
<!--TODO: Add panel with the threshold for counting folds--> Under the
baseline condition without mitotic domains or germ band extension (only
noise), we observe no ectopic fold formation for any bending rigidity
values (Figure <a href="#fig:model">3</a>e). The probability of buckling
increases with the germ band extension and inversely with the bending
rigidity (Figure <a href="#fig:model">3</a>e, Figure <a
href="#fig:model-features">S6</a>b). We observe a buckling transition in
the phase space in softer conditions

the germ band alone cannot drive the formation of ectopic folds even at
its maximum extension (Figure <a href="#fig:model">3</a>e, Figure <a
href="#fig:model-features">S6</a>b). Adding mitotic domains to the
simulations caused a shift in the phase diagram, with the probability of
ectopic fold formation increasing even in low values of germ band
extension and higher values of bending rigidity (Figure <a
href="#fig:model">3</a>f, Figure <a href="#fig:model-features">S6</a>c).
Mitotic domains alone can induce ectopic folds in softer conditions
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>K</mi><mi>b</mi><mo>*</mo></msubsup><mo>&lt;</mo><mn>1.1</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_b^* &lt; 1.1 \times 10^{−4}</annotation></semantics></math>).
For most of the parameter space, the combined action of mitotic domains
and germ band maximizes the probability of ectopic fold formation
(Figure <a href="#fig:model">3</a>e,f). These simulations show that
above certain a bending rigidity
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>K</mi><mi>b</mi><mo>*</mo></msubsup><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>1.0</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_b^* &gt; 1.0 \times 10^{−4}</annotation></semantics></math>),
neither the mitotic domains nor the germ band can drive ectopic folding
by themselves. We thus set to test these predictions <em>in vivo</em> by
performing perturbation experiments to individually inhibit the
formation of mitotic domains and the extension of the germ band.</p>
<!--TODO:AB: Give a physics-based estimation of order of magnitude of dimensionless parameter from literature. Good sanity check to see if values are not off the charts!-->
<p>We first asked whether the extension of the germ band alone can
generate ectopic folds. To that end, we generated double-mutant flies
lacking both the cephalic furrow and the mitotic domains by combining
<em>btd</em> mutants with a loss-of-function allele of <em>cdc25</em> or
<em>string</em> (<em>stg</em>), a phosphatase that regulates the cell
divisions in cleavage cycle 14 of <em>Drosophila</em><span

href="#fig:vid-stg-lateral">Video S4</a>, Figure <a
href="#fig:vid-stg-dorsal">Video S5</a>). Compared to wildtype, the
ectopic folds in <em>stg</em> mutants are less frequent and primarily
appear near the trunk–germ interface (Table <a href="#tbl:stats">2</a>),
which suggests that mitotic domains affects ectopic folding. Indeed, in
<em>btd</em>–<em>stg</em> double-mutant embryos, we find no ectopic
folds forming at the head–trunk interface (Figure <a
href="#fig:experiments">4</a>a,b,j, Figure <a
href="#fig:vid-double-lateral">Video 10</a>). The experiment shows that
mitotic domains are required for ectopic folding, and the push from the
germ band extension alone is insufficient to induce ectopic buckling in
cephalic furrow mutants.</p>
<p>To test whether mitotic domains alone are sufficient to induce
ectopic buckling <em>in vivo</em>, we mechanically blocked the extension
of the germ band in cephalic furrow mutants. For that, we cauterized a
patch of dorsal tissue, attaching it to the vitelline envelope at the
onset of gastrulation (Figure <a href="#fig:experiments">4</a>c). When
the germ band extension is blocked in <em>btd</em> and <em>eve</em>
mutants, no ectopic folds appear at the head–trunk interface (Figure <a
href="#fig:experiments">4</a>c,d,j, <a href="#fig:vid-cautlat-eve">Video
7</a>, <a href="#fig:vid-cautdor-eve">Video 8</a>, <a
href="#fig:vid-cautdor-btd">Video 9</a>). Mitotic expansions compress
the neighboring non-dividing cells, but no buckling occurs (Figure <a
href="#fig:experiments">4</a>c). Cauterized mutant embryos also show
less epithelial deformations compared to non-cauterized mutant embryos
(Figure <a href="#fig:experiments">4</a>d,g). These experiments reveal
that <em>in vivo</em>, the local expansions of mitotic domains are
insufficient to cause epithelial buckling at the head–trunk interface,
and that the germ band extension is required.</p>
<!--TODO: Laser cut experiments. Consider adding them here starting with: “MD and GB generate mechanical forces and tissue flows that converge to the head--trunk boundary. If that’s the case, we expect that these tissues are under compression, and thus, would not show any recoil if cut using laser. To test that...”. The reasoning would almost the same as the one from the next paragraph: we observe that when MD and GB generate opposing flows at the same time the epithelial undergoes a buckling transition forming ectopic folds, we observe that the first epithelial cells to buckle are usually non-dividing between MDs and between MD/GB that become compressed immediately before the formation of the EF, these observations in combination with our models suggested that compressive stresses are driving a buckling transition in CF mutants, which in addition in a mutant situation there’s an excess of tissue in the surface due to the absence of the CF and the threshold for a buckling transition is even lower and these compressive forces are even more effective, if that’s the case, if these epithelial cells are being compressed and are under pressure we expect that a cut orthogonal to the predicted forces would show no recoil and possibly the tissue would collapse in itself. To test this hypothesis in vivo we performed painstaking laser cuts in cephalic furrow mutants and saw just that, if non-dividing cells between MDs or between MD/GB are cut we see no recoil, this supports our view that compressive forces are the essential driving forces underlying EF formation in cephalic furrow mutants and additionally it reveals that the HT is under compressive stresses from at least these two opposing morphogenetic events at gastrulation the MD and GB-->
<p>These <em>in vivo</em> experiments show that neither the mitotic
domains nor the germ band can promote ectopic folding by themselves. In
our model, these situations occur around a bending rigidity of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>K</mi><mi>b</mi><mo>*</mo></msubsup><mo>≈</mo><mn>1.0</mn><mo>×</mo><msup><mn>10</mn><mrow><mo>−</mo><mn>4</mn></mrow></msup></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">K_b^* \approx 1.0 \times 10^{−4}</annotation></semantics></math>.
It is at this bending rigidity that the number of folds in simulations
without mitotic domains and maximum germ band extension
(<em>btd</em>–<em>stg</em> double mutant), and in simulations with
mitotic domains and minimum germ band extension (<em>btd</em> or
<em>eve</em> mutants), begin to fall below 1 (Figure <a
href="#fig:model-features">S6</a>b,c). This suggests that the bending
rigidity regime of the epithelium <em>in vivo</em> is around the same
order of magnitude.</p>
<!--TODO: Add sentence about correlation between model and real measurements. Here or discussion?

For the characterization of the CF, I chose the bending rigidity of the blastoderm as K_b^* = 10^{-4}. I analyzed how this value compares with the bending rigidity measured for previous studies. In Trushko 2020 and Fouchard 2020 , they estimate K_b \approx 5 \times 10^{-13} Nm and K_s \approx 0.2 Nm^{-1} for MDCK monolayers. By this measure the value of K_b^* for them would be 3.8\times 10^{-5}. This is lower than my estimate of the bending rigidity of the blastoderm. One reason for this mismatch could be different tissue thicknesses between the their study and our study. The thickness of the MDCK monolayer mentioned in Fouchard 2020 is about 18 \mu m while the typical thickness of the blastoderm as measured by my collaborators is about 40 \mu m. It is known that for elastic sheets K_b/K_s \propto h^2, where h is the thickness of the sheet . Thus, the height adjusted value of K^*_b as estimated by Fouchard 2020 should be 1.8 \times 10^{-4}. This is higher than our estimate but in the same order of magnitude.  Still, it must be noted that my model, like any other model, makes several simplifying assumptions.
-->
<p>Overall, our <em>in silico</em> modeling and <em>in vivo</em>
experiments suggest that the epithelial buckling at the head–trunk
interface in cephalic furrow mutants only occurs when both the mitotic
domain expansion and the germ band extension happen concomitantly. This
suggests that the combined activity of mitotic domains and germ band
extension increases the compressive stresses at the head–trunk boundary
during early gastrulation. In conditions where the cephalic furrow
formation is perturbed, this leads to more frequent and larger tissue
buckling events. Therefore, we hypothesize that the temporary storage of
invaginated cells folded in the cephalic furrow may contribute to
absorbing these compressive stresses generated by mitotic domains and
germ band extension in wildtype conditions.</p>
<p>To explore the role of the cephalic furrow as a mechanical buffer, we
analyzed computationally how it interacts with mitotic domains and with
the germ band, and how it influences the formation of ectopic folds. In
our model, we programmed the cephalic furrow by establishing an
intrinsic negative curvature
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msubsup><mi>κ</mi><mi>o</mi><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></msubsup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\kappa_o^{CF}</annotation></semantics></math>)
to a narrow region of the particle–spring blastoderm that matches the
span of the initiator cells <em>in vivo</em> (Figure <a
href="#fig:model">3</a>a, Figure <a href="#fig:proportions">S5</a>).
Using the bending rigidity fine-tuned with the previous simulations and
experiments, we ran a parameter sweep for different values of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msubsup><mi>κ</mi><mi>o</mi><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></msubsup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\kappa_o^{CF}</annotation></semantics></math>
and established a baseline
(<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><mrow><msubsup><mi>κ</mi><mi>o</mi><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></msubsup><mo>&gt;</mo><mn>0.3</mn></mrow><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\kappa_o^{CF}&gt;0.3</annotation></semantics></math>)
where the invagination forms in a robust manner with minimal
variability, phenocopying the cephalic furrow <em>in vivo</em>
(Figure <a href="#fig:cf-sweep">S8</a>a). Since our experiments indicate
that the germ band is compressing the head–trunk tissues, we first asked
whether the extension of the germ band can influence the depth of the
cephalic furrow.
<!--The simulations show that the average depth of the cephalic furrow correlates with the percentage of germ band extension ({@fig:model}i).-->
<!--Mitotic activity and germ band elongation contributes to the depth of the cephalic furrow [@Campos-Ortega1997-rd].-->
To test <em>in vivo</em> whether the presence of the germ band impacts
the formation of the cephalic furrow, we blocked the germ band extension
by cauterization in wildtype embryos. The cephalic furrow forms normally
in cauterized embryos indicating that the germ band extension is not
required for its formation (Figure <a href="#fig:experiments">4</a>e,f).
We then measured the maximum depth of the cephalic furrow between
cauterized and non-cauterized embryos. The cephalic furrow in cauterized
embryos is 15% shallower, but this difference was not significant,
indicating the germ band extension has at most a mild influence on the
depth of the cephalic furrow (Figure <a href="#fig:experiments">4</a>h).
<!--TODO: Add result of statistical test--> In addition, we performed a
complementary experiment to determine the size of the region under the
influence of the cephalic furrow. By laser ablating cell membranes at
different distances from initiator cells in early wildtype embryos, we
find that the recoil velocity increases with time and decreases with
distance, with an approximate range of at least 40µm anterior and
posterior to the initiator cells (Figure <a
href="#fig:experiments">4</a>i). This suggests the cephalic furrow
actively generates tension by pulling the surrounding tissues. These
experiments rule out the germ band extension as a driver of cephalic
furrow invagination, and give support to the notion that the cephalic
furrow forms autonomously by independent active mechanisms which are
deployed before the other morphogenetic movements of gastrulation.</p>
<!--TODO:AB: Is the increase in recoil velocity because CF or epithelial maturation?-->
<p>Next, we tested the conditions that impact the effectiveness of the
cephalic furrow in preventing the formation of ectopic folds. We ran
simulations changing the strength of the cephalic furrow, the timing of
mitotic domain formation, and the percentage of germ band extension, and
quantified the frequency, the position, and the depth of ectopic folds.
Without the germ band, the presence of an active invagination at the
head–trunk region reduced the variability of ectopic folding in the
neighborhood of the cephalic furrow (Figure <a
href="#fig:model">3</a>g). This influence of the cephalic furrow on
ectopic folds correlates with the strength of the pull, with higher
values preventing ectopic folds more effectively (Figure <a
href="#fig:model">3</a>g,h, Figure <a href="#fig:cf-sweep">S8</a>b).
Curiously, this buffering effect diminished with the extension of the
germ band for intermediate values of
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msubsup><mi>κ</mi><mi>o</mi><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></msubsup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\kappa_o^{CF}</annotation></semantics></math>
(Figure <a href="#fig:cf-sweep">S8</a>b). The cephalic furrow becomes
shallower and there is an increase in ectopic folds at the posterior
region. Only larger
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msubsup><mi>κ</mi><mi>o</mi><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></msubsup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\kappa_o^{CF}</annotation></semantics></math>
values remained effective in preventing ectopic folds at high
percentages of germ band extension (Figure <a
href="#fig:cf-sweep">S8</a>b). This suggests that in these conditions,
the forces generated by the mitotic expansions and by the germ band
extension dominate over the infolding pull of the cephalic furrow.</p>
<p>Finally, given that in wildtype embryos the cephalic furrow forms
around 15 min before mitotic domains, we asked whether their relative
timing of formation may influence the effectiveness of the cephalic
furrow. Indeed, when we added a delay to the formation of mitotic
domains, the cephalic furrow is more effective in preventing ectopic
folding even for lower
<math display="inline" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"><semantics><msubsup><mi>κ</mi><mi>o</mi><mrow><mi>C</mi><mi>F</mi></mrow></msubsup><annotation encoding="application/x-tex">\kappa_o^{CF}</annotation></semantics></math>
values and for greater percentages of germ band extension (Figure <a
href="#fig:model">3</a>g,h, Figure <a href="#fig:cf-sweep">S8</a>b).
Ectopic folds only form in the posterior region near the germ band tip,
a position notably similar to where the dorsal folds form in the
<em>Drosophila</em> embryo <em>in vivo</em>. Taken together, our
physical model provides a theoretical basis that an early pre-patterned
invagination can effectively prevent mechanical instabilities by
absorbing compressive stresses in the tissue.</p>
<!--TODO: Timing effectiveness is not exemplified in the last panel-->
<h1 id="discussion">Discussion</h1>
<!--Our work brings a novel perspective on the function of the cephalic furrow as a transient tissue reservoir that maintains the epithelial integrity when compressive stresses increase during gastrulation.-->
<p>Our results provide evidence that the cephalic furrow accomplishes a
physical role during the early gastrulation of <em>Drosophila</em>. We
found that without the cephalic furrow, the epithelium becomes unstable
and subject to erratic buckling events. These ectopic folds, unlike the
cephalic furrow, form due to extrinsic forces. We identified two main
sources of mechanical stress acting at the head–trunk boundary during
gastrulation, mitotic domains and germ band. Mitotic cells have been
shown to induce epithelial folding in the tracheal placode of flies<span
class="citation" data-cites="Kondo2013-gy"><sup><a

data-cites="Freddo2016-et"><sup><a href="#ref-Freddo2016-et"

class="citation" data-cites="Gupta2021-oo"><sup><a

Second, dividing cells can undergo basal detachment and shorten along

class="citation" data-cites="Ko2020-wk"><sup><a href="#ref-Ko2020-wk"
role="doc-biblioref">19</a></sup></span>. We believe that both
processes, the apical expansion and basal detachment prime the formation
of ectopic folds in cephalic furrow mutants. However, we found that
mitotic domains alone cannot induce buckling, and that a concomitant
compression from the germ band extension is required. Compressive forces
are a key mechanism forming epithelial folds in development<span

role="doc-biblioref">16</a>,<a href="#ref-Freddo2016-et"
role="doc-biblioref">17</a></sup></span>. Our data suggest a similar
situation is occurring at the head–trunk boundary of cephalic furrow
mutants. The synchronized apical expansion of dividing cells in mitotic
domains pushes the adjacent non-dividing cells outward, and forms
potentially unstable regions of different epithelial thickness, while
the germ band extension generates a global compression on the head–trunk
interface (Figure <a href="#fig:summary">5</a>a,b).
<!--The fact that *eve* mutants have no cell intercalation [@Collinet2015-af] suggests that the formation of ectopic folds depends on the rapid phase of germ band extension [@Campos-Ortega1985-ma], driven mainly by the posterior midgut invagination.-->
In a condition where there is an excess of tissue on the embryonic
surface (no cephalic furrow), the increased compressive stresses
compromise the stability of the epithelium during gastrulation. This
suggests the head–trunk epithelium is under mechanical stress from the
morphogenetic movements of gastrulation in normal development.</p>
<p>Our findings give support to the idea that the cephalic furrow is
preventing the build up of these compressive stresses at the head–trunk
boundary. The presence of the cephalic furrow abolishes the formation of
ectopic folds in sibling controls and in our simulations, suggesting
that invaginating tissue out-of-plane is an effective way to alleviate
compressive stresses.
<!--prd mutant shows that partially perturbing CF formation is enough to prime the position of folding.-->
The pre-patterned position of the initiator cells, and the active
cellular mechanisms deployed to drive the cephalic furrow invagination
at the onset of gastrulation, anticipates the compressive stresses at
the head–trunk boundary. When mitotic domains appear, a significant
portion of the head epithelium is already invaginated and the mechanical
forces in the tissue are directed to a single, predictable fold. The
relative timing of invagination in respect to the other morphogenetic
movements is a crucial factor for preventing mechanical instabilities in
the tissue. We thus propose that the transient storage created by the
cephalic furrow has a stress-absorbing role, contributing to safeguard
the integrity of the epithelial monolayer at the head–trunk boundary
during gastrulation.</p>
<!--TODO:CDM: No space to discuss the egg shape implications, I guess? Or did we decide to hold that for a follow-up?-->
<p>What remains unclear, however, is whether the increased tissue
strain, or the buckling itself, have any adverse effects to
embryogenesis. An ectopic fold can, for instance, disrupt cell-to-cell
interactions or short-range signaling, leading to patterning
defects—especially if they occur when tissues are being specified as
during gastrulation. Physical compression may also impact the
differentiation of tissues since cells can sense and respond to
mechanical stimuli with changes in patterning<span class="citation"
data-cites="Heisenberg2013-pl"><sup><a href="#ref-Heisenberg2013-pl"
role="doc-biblioref">22</a></sup></span>. More generally, variable
ectopic buckling may slow down morphogenesis. In this sense, a canalized
process forming a single predictable invagination may improve
developmental robustness and allow for faster development, bringing an
evolutionary advantage for embryos with a pre-patterned head
invagination. This raises an intriguing evolutionary question—if the
cephalic furrow has a mechanical role in development, did it first
evolve in response to these mechanical stresses of gastrulation? If this
was the case, we expect the sources of stress (mitotic domains and germ
band extension) to be present in the fly lineage before the evolution of
the cephalic furrow. Strikingly, that appears to be the case. Mapping
the cephalic furrow in the dipteran phylogeny suggests that the cephalic
furrow is an evolutionary novelty that evolved after the appearance of
mitotic domains and long germ<span class="citation"
data-cites="Lemke2023-cx"><sup><a href="#ref-Lemke2023-cx"
role="doc-biblioref">23</a></sup></span> (Figure <a
href="#fig:summary">5</a>c, Steffen Lemke personal communication). One
putative scenario is that selection for shorter developmental times
concatenated the formation of mitotic domains and germ band extension,
increasing the mechanical instabilities at the head–trunk boundary
(Figure <a href="#fig:summary">5</a>d). In this case, mechanical stress
may have acted as a selective pressure for the evolution of a
pre-patterned head invagination, averting the potential detrimental
effects of mechanical instabilities. These speculations, however,
require further testing with experiments that prevent cephalic furrow
formation without other genetic side effects, as well as a systematic
comparative analysis of mitotic domains, germ band extension, and tissue
mechanics across the fly phylogeny. Overall, our work proposes that the
cephalic furrow plays a mechanical role in absorbing compressive
stresses in fly gastrulation, and introduces the cephalic furrow
formation as powerful context to test the hypothesis that mechanical
interactions within embryonic tissues may play an important role for the
evolution of morphogenesis in early development.</p>
<!--Alternatively, the evolution of the cephalic furrow was in fact the facilitator to allowing for faster development.-->
<!--Physical interaction of embryonic tissues with the egg shell are important for morphogenesis [@Bailles2019-qs; @Munster2019-ww]-->
<!--Our simulations also revealed the buckling events are influenced by the roundness of the vitelline envelope. Buckling occurs more easily on straighter shells. This might explain why buckling at the tips is less frequent. Friction plays a role in the shape of the fold [Trushko]. Recent works show how interactions of the embryonic tissues with the shell [@Munster;@Bailles] and between gastrulation movements [@Guo2021] are important to embryonic development. Insect eggs have an outstanding diversity [@Church]. This observation might have implications to how egg shape might have influenced the evolution of development. And reveal a glimpse of the complex mechanical underpinnings of gastrulation dynamics around the head--trunk boundary of bilaterians.-->
<!--Mechanical instability perturbs patterning and causes the loss of ATP, which may lead to  developmental delays-->
<!--Our findings also explain why so few cephalic furrow mutants have been identified. Because even though the cephalic furrow is disrupted, the tissue compression from other gastrulation movements will still make the epithelium fold, making the cephalic furrow phenotypes less obvious-->
<!--Dividing cells can’t do morphogenesis. That’s why mitotic domains occur in patches. Otherwise, gastrulation movements would fail.-->

<p>To generate fluorescent cephalic furrow mutants, we performed genetic
crosses using the loss-of-function alleles <em>btd<sup>XA</sup></em>
(FBal0030657), <em>eve<sup>3</sup></em> (FBal0003885),
<em>prd<sup>4</sup></em> (FBal0013967), and <em>stg<sup>2</sup></em>
(FBal0247234); the membrane fluorescent marker <em>Gap43-mCherry</em>
(FBal0258719, gift from Kassiani Skouloudaki); and the green fluorescent
balancers <em>FM7c, Kr-GFP</em> (FBst0005193), <em>CyO, twi-GFP</em>
(gift from Akanksha Jain), and <em>TM3, Kr-GFP</em> (FBst0005195). We
established stable lines balancing the loss-of-function alleles with
fluorescent balancers, and used the lack of GFP signal to identify
homozygous embryos in our live-imaging recordings. For genes on
chromosomes 1 and 2 (<em>btd</em>, <em>eve</em>, and <em>prd</em>), we
added the membrane marker on chromosome 3 (<em>btd<sup>XA</sup>/FM7c,
Kr-GFP;; Gap43-mCherry/MKRS</em> and <em>eve<sup>3</sup>/CyO, twi-GFP;
Gap43-mCherry/MKRS</em>). For <em>stg</em>, which is located on
chromosome 3, we recombined the allele with Gap (<em>Gap43-mCherry,
stg<sup>2</sup>/TM3, Kr-GFP</em>). Since the <em>btd</em>–<em>stg</em>
double mutant stable line is weak, we imaged the progeny of
<em>btd<sup>XA</sup>/FM7c, Kr-GFP;; Gap43-mCherry,
stg<sup>2</sup>/Gap43-mCherry</em> flies, identifying <em>btd</em>
homozygozity by the GFP, and <em>stg</em> homozygozity by the lack of
cell divisions after gastrulation. The wildtype stocks contain the Gap
marker in the Oregon-R genetic background. We obtained the founder fly
stocks from the Bloomington Drosophila Stock Center and the Kyoto Stock
Center and deposited the lines in the MPI-CBG stock collection. The

<h2 id="animal-husbandry-and-embryo-collection">Animal husbandry and
embryo collection</h2>
<p>We maintained the stocks in 50mL hard plastic vials containing fly
food and enclosed with a foam lid. They were kept in an incubator with a
constant 25°C temperature and 65% humidity and a 12:12h light cycle. For
imaging, we first amplified the stocks in larger 200mL tubes for a few
weeks. We then narcotized the flies with CO<sub>2</sub>, and transferred
them to a cage with a plate attached to one end containing a layer of
apple juice agar and a slab of yeast paste on top. The flies were left
to acclimatize in the cage for two days before the experiments. To
guarantee the embryos are at a similar developmental stage, we exchanged
the agar plate once per hour at least twice (pre-lays), and let the
flies lay the eggs on the agar for one hour before collecting the plate.
After filling the plate with water, we used a brush to release the eggs
from the agar and transferred them to a cell strainer with 100µm nylon
mesh (VWR). To remove the chorion, we immersed the embryos in 20% sodium
hypochlorite solution (Merck 1.05614.2500) for 90s, washed abundantly
with water, and proceeded to mounting for live imaging.</p>
<h2 id="sample-mounting-for-live-imaging">Sample mounting for live
imaging</h2>
<p>We performed most of our live imaging in Zeiss Lightsheet Z.1
microscope using a mounting strategy optimized to increase the
throughput of samples in one session. First, we cut a 22x22mm glass
coverslip (0.17mm thickness) into 6x15mm strips using a diamond knife,
and attached a single strip to a custom sample holder using silicon
glue, letting it harden for 15min. We then coated the coverslip strip
with a thin layer of heptane glue and let it dry while preparing the
embryos. Using a fine brush, we transferred the embryos collected in the
cell strainer onto an agar pad, and oriented them manually with a blunt
cactus spine under a stereomicroscope. We aligned about 20 embryos in a
single line (head to tail) along the main axis of the strip with the
left or ventral sides up, depending on the experiment. To attach the
embryos to the coverslip, we carefully lowered the sample holder over
the agar pad until the glass coated with heptane glue touched the
embryos. We placed the sample holder into the microscope chamber filled
with water, and rotated it so that the samples are facing the detection
objective directly, and the coverslip is orthogonal to the detection
objective; this is important to prevent the lightsheet from hitting the
glass edges. With the embryos oriented vertically along the coverslip,
the lightsheet generated from the illumination objectives coming from
the sides only needs to pass through the width of the embryo (about
200µm). This approach gives the best optics for recording lateral and
dorsal views and is ideal for live imaging homozygote embryos since they
are only about one fourth of the total number of imaged embryos.</p>
<h2 id="microscopy-and-acquisition-parameters">Microscopy and
acquisition parameters</h2>
<p>For lateral datasets, we used a Zeiss 20x/1NA Plan-Apochromat water
immersion objective to acquire stacks with 0.28µm XY-resolution and 3µm
Z-resolution covering half of the embryo’s volume in a single view. This
Z-resolution was restored to 1µm during image processing (see below).
For dorsal datasets, we used a Zeiss 40x/1NA Plan-Apochromat water
immersion objective to acquire stacks with 0.14µm XY-resolution and 3µm
Z-resolution covering a volume around in the middle section of the
anterior end of the embryo. We adjusted the time resolution between
45–60s per frame to maximize the number of embryos acquired in one
session. To visualize both the membrane signal (mCherry) and the green
balancer signal (GFP), we acquired two channels simultaneously using the
488 and 561nm lasers at 3% power with an image splitter cube containing
a LP560 dichromatic mirror with SP550 and LP585 emission filters. All
recordings were performed at 25°C.</p>

<h2 id="ectopic-folding-timing-and-dynamics">Ectopic folding timing and
dynamics</h2>
<p>To characterize the relative timing of ectopic folding, we annotated
the germ band position and the number of frames after the onset of
gastrulation at the initial buckling, when the first cells disappear
from the surface in the lateral 3D renderings. We defined the onset of
gastrulation (T=0) as the moment immediately after the end of
cellularization, and immediately before the beginning of the ventral
furrow invagination. To visualize the variability of ectopic folding, we
manually traced the fold outlines in lateral recordings using Fiji.
Because embryos have different sizes, we first used the plugin
<em>bUnwarpJ</em><span class="citation"
data-cites="Arganda-Carreras2006-im"><sup><a

role="doc-biblioref">34</a></sup></span> (<a
href="https://imagej.net/plugins/bunwarpj/">imagej.net/plugins/bunwarpj</a>)
to register individual frames and then applied the same transformation
to the fold traces for a standardized comparison. We analyzed the
dynamics of ectopic folds by measuring the relative angle and tortuosity
of the segmented line traces over time, and to visualize the kinetics we
generated color-coded temporal projections using the script <em>Temporal
Color Code</em> (<a
href="https://imagej.net/plugins/temporal-color-code">imagej.net/plugins/temporal-color-code</a>)
with the perceptually uniform <em>mpl-viridis</em> color map (<a

<h2 id="ectopic-folding-area-and-depth">Ectopic folding area and

<p>To estimate the folded area in the cephalic furrow and ectopic folds,
we annotated the region of the blastoderm before gastrulation that
infolded in the cartographic projections using Fiji, and calculated the
area correcting the pixel dimensions according to the coordinates in the
projection. For the fold depth, we measured the distance between the
vitelline envelope to the tip of the fold at the moment of maximum depth
in the dorsal recordings. For the analysis of the epithelial surface, we
used the plugin <em>MorphoLibJ</em><span class="citation"
data-cites="Legland2016-cp"><sup><a href="#ref-Legland2016-cp"
role="doc-biblioref">35</a></sup></span> (<a

plugin <em>Linear Stack Alignment with SIFT</em> <a
href="https://imagej.net/plugins/linear-stack-alignment-with-sift">imagej.net/plugins/linear-stack-alignment-with-sift</a>
to register cells between timepoints.</p>
<h2 id="laser-cauterization-experiments">Laser cauterization
experiments</h2>
<p>We performed laser cauterization experiments in two microscope
setups, a Luxendo MuVi SPIM with a photomanipulation module and a Zeiss
LSM 780 NLO with multiphoton excitation. For the MuVi SPIM, we embedded
dechorionated embryos in 2% low-melting agarose and mounted the samples
in glass capillaries to obtain <em>in toto</em> recordings. We used a
pulsed infrared laser 1030–1040nm with 200fs pulse duration and 1.5W
power to cauterize the posterior region of the dorsal embryonic surface,
attaching the blastoderm to the vitelline envelope. Using a Olympus
20x/1.0NA water immersion objective, we acquired stacks with 0.29µm
XY-resolution and 1µm Z-resolution of four different angles every one
minute. For the Zeiss microscope, we attached the embryos with the
dorsal side down onto coverslips using heptane glue and immersing in
halocarbon oil. We cauterized the embryos sequentially using a near
infrared 800nm laser (Chameleon Vision II) through a single pixel line
(210nm/px and 100µs/px) around the same dorsal region to block the germ
band extension. We used a Zeiss 25x/0.8NA LD LCI Plan-Apochromat
glycerol immersion objective to acquire every 2:38min two different
planes of the blastoderm, (i) the surface to monitor the germ band
extension, and (ii) 40µm deep in the equatorial region to monitor the
occurrence of ectopic folding. The stacks had 0.21µm XY-resolution and
one minute time resolution. <!--TODO: Temperature in MuVi and Zeiss?-->
To obtain a quantitative measure of ectopic folding, we analyzed the
degree by which the tissues deform between non-cauterized and cauterized
mutants using as a proxy the tortuosity of the epithelium outline. For
that, we took the profile slices from dorsal recordings and transformed
the curved vitelline envelope into a straight line using the
<em>Straighten</em> tool of ImageJ (Figure <a
href="#fig:tortuosity">S9</a>a). We then cropped a 200×25µm region along
the head–trunk interface and applied gaussian blur, thresholding, and
edge detection to obtain the epithelium outline for individual
timepoints covering about 50min after gastrulation (Figure <a
href="#fig:tortuosity">S9</a>a,b). We extracted measurements from the
epithelium outlines using the ImageJ plugin <em>Analyze
Skeleton</em><span class="citation"

and generated the color-coded temporal projections as described
above.</p>
<h2 id="laser-ablation-experiments">Laser ablation experiments</h2>
<p>We performed laser ablations in a Yokogawa CSU-X1 confocal spinning
disk, an EMCCD camera (Andor iXon DU-888), and the software AndorIQ for
image acquisition. We attached dechorionated embryos laterally to a
MatTek glass-bottom petri dish and covered the samples with water, and
performed the ablations using a Titanium Sapphire Chameleon Ultra II
(Coherent) laser at 800nm tuned down from 80MHz to 20kHz with a
pulse-picker. The laser power measured before the microscope port was 6
mW and the pixel dwell time for scanning was 2µs.
<!--TODO: What is the brand of the objective?--> To ensure the cut, we
repeated the scan ten consecutive times along a single cell acquiring a
single slice with a 60x/1.2NA water immersion objective with 0.18µm
XY-resolution and 200ms time-steps. We ablated each embryo just once.
<!--TODO: Does a higher temperature affects the quantifications?--> The
temperature was maintained at 28°C. To analyse the ablation data, we
created a line crossing the edges of the ablated cell perpendicular to
the cut and generated a kymograph using the <em>Multi Kymograph</em>
Fiji plugin (Figure <a href="#fig:ablation">S10</a>). We then binarized
the kymographs, measured the distance between cell edges over the first
30s after the cut, and performed a linear fit of the data to obtain the
recoil velocity (Figure <a href="#fig:ablation">S10</a>).</p>
<h2 id="strain-rate-analysis">Strain rate analysis</h2>
<p>To estimate the strain rates, we first performed particle image
velocimetry on cartographic projections using the ImageJ plugin
<em>iterativePIV</em><span class="citation"

is the displacement obtained in the PIV divided by the time in minutes.
The measurements combine isotropic and anisotropic strain rate. We used
these values to create a color-coded overlay for the strain rate
(Figure <a href="#fig:strain">S4</a>). To generate the line plots, we
averaged the strain rate along the dorsoventral axis in two pre-defined
regions, the head–trunk (canonical cephalic furrow position) and the
trunk–germ (posterior to the Mitotic Domain 6) (Figure <a

The blastoderm is confined by a rigid boundary in the shape of a
semi-ellipse and any particle that lands outside this boundary is
re-positioned to mid-point between the initial and current position
where it intersects with the boundary. Finally, we define and count as a
<em>fold</em> a particle whose distance to the rigid boundary is greater
than the maximum distance traveled by particles under ground level noise
(equals to 0.035L).</p>
