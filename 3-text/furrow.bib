               tissues in the foregut, surface ectoderm, and the head ganglion

  abstract = "Although gastrulation is regarded as the stage during Drosophila
              development when the AP patterning system first influences
              morphological processes, transcription is regulated in complex
              patterns already at cycle 10. How soon this transcriptional
              complexity produces spatial differences in morphology has been
              unclear. We report on two new processes that establish visible
              morphological inhomogeneities before the onset of gastrulation.
              The first of these is the regulation of syncytial nuclear
              densities in the anterior end of the egg and represents the first
              zygotically driven AP asymmetry in the embryo. The second process
              is the generation of a fine-scale pattern in the actin/myosin
              array during cellularization. We find three domains of different
              yolk stalk diameters as well as depths of cellularization along
              the AP axis. These domains are established under the control of
              the AP patterning system and require bicoid activity. The
              anterior-most domain is a region of large yolk stalk diameters
              and corresponds to the region of decreased nuclear densities
              observed during syncytial stages. The middle domain shows smaller
              yolk stalk diameters and more rapid cellularization. Its
              establishment requires wild-type paired activity and thus
              indirectly requires bicoid. It occurs in a region of the embryo
              that ultimately gives rise to the cephalic furrow and may account
              for the effect of paired on that structure during gastrulation.
              Our results therefore suggest a link between cytoskeletal
              organization during cellularization and subsequent morphogenetic
              processes of gastrulation.",

  abstract = "In embryos of Drosophila melanogaster all the nuclei in the
              syncytial egg divide with global synchrony during the first 13
              mitotic cycles. But with cellularization in the 14th cycle,
              global mitotic synchrony ceases. Starting about one hour into the
              14th interphase, at least 25 'mitotic domains', which are
              clusters of cells united by locally synchronous mitosis,
              partition the embryo blastoderm surface into a complex fine-scale
              pattern. These mitotic domains, which are constant from one
              embryo to the next, fire in the same temporal sequence in every
              embryo. Some domains consist of a single cell cluster straddling
              the ventral or dorsal midline. Most consist of two separate cell
              clusters that occupy mirror-image positions on the bilaterally
              symmetric embryo. Others comprise a series of members present not
              only as bilateral pairs but also as metameric repeats. Thus a
              domain can consist of either one, two, or many (if metamerically
              reiterated) clusters of contiguous cells. Within each cluster,
              mitosis starts in a single cell or in a small number of interior
              cells then spreads wave-like, in all directions, until it stops
              at the domain boundary. Each domain occupies a specific position
              along the anteroposterior axis--as determined by the expression
              pattern of the engrailed protein, and along the dorsoventral
              axis--as determined by cell count from the ventral midline. The
              primordia of certain larval structures appear to consist solely
              of the cells of one specific mitotic domain. Moreover, cells in
              at least some mitotic domains share specific morphogenetic
              traits, distinct from those of cells in adjacent domains. These
              traits include cell shape, spindle orientation, and participation
              by all the cells of a domain in an invagination. The specialized
              behaviors of the various mitotic domains transform the monolayer
              cell sheet of the blastoderm into the multilayered gastrula. I
              conclude that the fine-scale partitioning of the newly
              cellularized embryo into mitotic domains is an early
              manifestation of the commitment of cells to specific

              first phase of cephalic furrow formation, the initiator cells
              that will lead invagination undergo apicobasal shortening and
              apical constriction in the absence of epithelial invagination. In

              development of most anterior regions of the body either in flies
              or vertebrates. Three Drosophila genes have been identified that
              are important in controlling the development of the head, two of
              which, empty spiracles and orthodenticle, have been cloned and
              shown to contain a homeobox. We previously cloned and
              characterized Emx1 and Emx2, two mouse genes related to empty

              developing forebrain, including the presumptive cerebral cortex

              diencephalic regions, both dorsally and ventrally. Finally, Emx1
              expression is exclusively confined to the dorsal telencephalon.
              Thus at the time when regional specification of major brain
              regions takes place, the expression domains of the four genes

              information, twice as much as would be expected if the expression
              patterns consisted only of on/off domains separated by sharp
              boundaries. Taken together, four gap genes carry enough
              information to define a cell's location with an error bar of ~1
              along the anterior/posterior axis of the embryo. This precision
              is nearly enough for each cell to have a unique identity, which
              is the maximum information the system can use, and is nearly
              constant along the length of the embryo. We argue that this
              constancy is a signature of optimality in the transmission of
              information from primary morphogen inputs to the output of the
              gap gene network.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: ImageJ is an image analysis program extensively used
              in the biological sciences and beyond. Due to its ease of use,
              recordable macro language, and extensible plug-in architecture,
              ImageJ enjoys contributions from non-programmers, amateur
              programmers, and professional developers alike. Enabling such a
              diversity of contributors has resulted in a large community that
              spans the biological and physical sciences. However, a rapidly
              growing user base, diverging plugin suites, and technical
              limitations have revealed a clear need for a concerted software
              engineering effort to support emerging imaging paradigms, to
              ensure the software's ability to handle the requirements of
              modern science. RESULTS: We rewrote the entire ImageJ codebase,
              engineering a redesigned plugin mechanism intended to facilitate
              extensibility at every level, with the goal of creating a more
              powerful tool that continues to serve the existing community
              while addressing a wider range of scientific requirements. This
              next-generation ImageJ, called ``ImageJ2'' in places where the
              distinction matters, provides a host of new functionality. It
              separates concerns, fully decoupling the data model from the user
              interface. It emphasizes integration with external applications
              to maximize interoperability. Its robust new plugin framework
              allows everything from image formats, to scripting languages, to
              visualization to be extended by the community. The redesigned
              data model supports arbitrarily large, N-dimensional datasets,
              which are increasingly common in modern image acquisition.
              Despite the scope of these changes, backwards compatibility is
              maintained such that this new functionality can be seamlessly
              integrated with the classic ImageJ interface, allowing users and
              developers to migrate to these new methods at their own pace.
              CONCLUSIONS: Scientific imaging benefits from open-source
              programs that advance new method development and deployment to a
              diverse audience. ImageJ has continuously evolved with this idea
              in mind; however, new and emerging scientific requirements have
              posed corresponding challenges for ImageJ's development. The
              described improvements provide a framework engineered for
              flexibility, intended to support these requirements as well as
              accommodate future needs. Future efforts will focus on
              implementing new algorithms in this framework and expanding
              collaborations with other popular scientific software suites.",

              contractile machinery drive embryo morphogenesis. During
              Drosophila embryonic axis extension, actomyosin has a specific
              planar-polarised organisation, which is responsible for oriented
              cell intercalation. In addition to these cell rearrangements,
              cell shape changes also contribute to tissue deformation. While
              cell-autonomous dynamics are well described, understanding the
              tissue-scale behaviour challenges us to solve the corresponding
              mechanical problem at the scale of the whole embryo, since
              mechanical resistance of all neighbouring epithelia will feedback
              on individual cells. Here we propose a novel numerical approach
              to compute the whole-embryo dynamics of the actomyosin-rich
              apical epithelial surface. We input in the model specific
              patterns of actomyosin contractility, such as the
              planar-polarisation of actomyosin in defined ventro-lateral
              regions of the embryo. Tissue strain rates and displacements are
              then predicted over the whole embryo surface according to the
              global balance of stresses and the material behaviour of the
              epithelium. Epithelia are modelled using a rheological law that
              relates the rate of deformation to the local stresses and
              actomyosin anisotropic contractility. Predicted flow patterns are
              consistent with the cell flows observed when imaging Drosophila
              axis extension in toto, using light sheet microscopy. The
              agreement between model and experimental data indicates that the
              anisotropic contractility of planar-polarised actomyosin in the
              ventro-lateral germband tissue can directly cause the
              tissue-scale deformations of the whole embryo. The
              three-dimensional mechanical balance is dependent on the geometry
              of the embryo, whose curved surface is taken into account in the
              simulations. Importantly, we find that to reproduce experimental
              flows, the model requires the presence of the cephalic furrow, a
              fold located anteriorly of the extending tissues. The presence of
              this geometric feature, through the global mechanical balance,
              guides the flow and orients extension towards the posterior end.",

              process during embryogenesis, by which the length of the

              This lengthening is achieved by typical convergent extension,

              concentration dictates gene expression and morphogenesis programs
              that ultimately lead to patterns in Drosophila embryos, we
              manipulate maternally supplied patterning determinants and
              measure readout concentration at the position of various
              developmental markers. When we increase the overall amount of the
              maternal TF Bicoid (Bcd) fivefold, Bcd concentrations in cells at
              positions of the cephalic furrow, an early morphological marker,
              differ by a factor of 2. This finding apparently contradicts the
              traditional threshold-dependent readout model, which predicts
              that the Bcd concentrations at these positions should be
              identical. In contrast, Bcd concentration at target gene
              expression boundaries is nearly unchanged early in development
              but adjusts dynamically toward the same twofold change as
              development progresses. Thus, the Drosophila segmentation gene
              network responds faithfully to Bcd concentration during early
              development, in agreement with the threshold model, but
              subsequently partially adapts in response to altered Bcd dosage,
              driving segmentation patterns toward their WT positions. This
              dynamic response requires other maternal regulators, such as
              Torso and Nanos, suggesting that integration of maternal input
              information is not achieved through molecular interactions at the

  abstract = "During gastrulation, physical forces reshape the simple embryonic
              tissue to form the complex body plans of multicellular
              organisms1. These forces often cause large-scale asymmetric
              movements of the embryonic tissue2,3. In many embryos, the
              gastrulating tissue is surrounded by a rigid protective shell4.
              Although it is well-recognized that gastrulation movements depend
              on forces that are generated by tissue-intrinsic
              contractility5,6, it is not known whether interactions between
              the tissue and the protective shell provide additional forces
              that affect gastrulation. Here we show that a particular part of
              the blastoderm tissue of the red flour beetle (Tribolium
              castaneum) tightly adheres in a temporally coordinated manner to
              the vitelline envelope that surrounds the embryo. This attachment
              generates an additional force that counteracts tissue-intrinsic
              contractile forces to create asymmetric tissue movements. This
              localized attachment depends on an Œ±PS2 integrin (inflated), and
              the knockdown of this integrin leads to a gastrulation phenotype
              that is consistent with complete loss of attachment. Furthermore,
              analysis of another integrin (the Œ±PS3 integrin, scab) in the
              fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) suggests that gastrulation in
              this organism also relies on adhesion between the blastoderm and
              the vitelline envelope. Our findings reveal a conserved mechanism
              through which the spatiotemporal pattern of tissue adhesion to
              the vitelline envelope provides controllable, counteracting
              forces that shape gastrulation movements in insects.",

  abstract = "Genetic and molecular analyses of patterning of the Drosophila

              fundamentally different from the process of segmentation of the
              trunk. The cephalic furrow (CF), one of the first morphological
              manifestations of the patterning process, forms at the
              juxtaposition of these two patterning systems. We report here
              that the initial step in CF formation is a change in shape and
              apical positioning of a single row of cells. The anteroposterior
              position of these initiator cells may be defined by the
              overlapping expression of the head gap gene buttonhead (btd) and
              the primary pair-rule gene even-skipped (eve). Re-examination of

              investigate the formation of the cephalic furrow, an epithelial
              fold that is precisely positioned with a linear morphology. Fold
              initiation is specified by a precise genetic code with
              single-cell row resolution. This positional code activates and
              spatially confines lateral myosin contractility to induce

              because of fluctuating myosin intensities at the cellular level.
              Nevertheless, the furrow remains linearly aligned. We find that

              membrane interfaces into supracellular ``ribbons.'' Local
              reduction of mechanical coupling at the ``ribbons'' using

  abstract = "How the shape of embryos and organs emerges during development is
              a fundamental question that has fascinated scientists for
              centuries. Tissue dynamics arise from a small set of cell
              behaviours, including shape changes, cell contact remodelling,
              cell migration, cell division and cell extrusion. These
              behaviours require control over cell mechanics, namely active
              stresses associated with protrusive, contractile and adhesive
              forces, and hydrostatic pressure, as well as material properties
              of cells that dictate how cells respond to active stresses. In
              this Review, we address how cell mechanics and the associated
              cell behaviours are robustly organized in space and time during
              tissue morphogenesis. We first outline how not only gene
              expression and the resulting biochemical cues, but also mechanics
              and geometry act as sources of morphogenetic information to
              ultimately define the time and length scales of the cell
              behaviours driving morphogenesis. Next, we present two idealized
              modes of how this information flows ‚Äî how it is read out and
              translated into a biological effect ‚Äî during morphogenesis. The
              first, akin to a programme, follows deterministic rules and is
              hierarchical. The second follows the principles of
              self-organization, which rests on statistical rules
              characterizing the system's composition and configuration, local
              interactions and feedback. We discuss the contribution of these
              two modes to the mechanisms of four very general classes of
              tissue deformation, namely tissue folding and invagination,
              tissue flow and extension, tissue hollowing and, finally, tissue
              branching. Overall, we suggest a conceptual framework for
              understanding morphogenetic information that encapsulates
              genetics and biochemistry as well as mechanics and geometry as
              information modules, and the interplay of deterministic and
              self-organized mechanisms of their deployment, thereby diverging
              considerably from the traditional notion that shape is fully

              metasynchronous waves. Mitoses after interphase 14 require
              zygotic transcription, and occur asyncronously in an intricate,

              provides a well-conserved mechanism to mediate epithelial
              folding. It remains unclear how contractile forces near the
              apical surface of a cell sheet drive out-of-plane bending of the
              sheet and whether myosin contractility is required throughout
              folding. By optogenetic-mediated acute inhibition of myosin, we
              find that during Drosophila mesoderm invagination, myosin
              contractility is critical to prevent tissue relaxation during the
              early, ``priming'' stage of folding but is dispensable for the

              divisions that occur concurrently in epithelia influence tissue
              shape is less understood. We addressed this question in two
              contexts of the early Drosophila embryo: premature cell division
              during mesoderm invagination, and native ectodermal cell
              divisions with ectopic activation of apical contractility. Using

              medioapical RhoA signaling. While premature mitotic entry
              inhibits mesoderm invagination, which relies on apical
              constriction, mitotic entry in an artificially contractile
              ectoderm induced ectopic tissue invaginations. Ectopic
              invaginations resulted from medioapical myosin loss in

              Thus, the spatial pattern of mitotic entry can differentially

              complex surface geometries has fascinated physicists and
              biologists alike for centuries. The most simple and yet versatile
              process of epithelial deformation is epithelial folding, through
              which curved shapes, tissue convolutions and internal structures
              are produced. The advent of quantitative live imaging, combined
              with experimental manipulation and computational modeling, has
              rapidly advanced our understanding of epithelial folding. In
              particular, a set of mechanical principles has emerged to
              illustrate how forces are generated and dissipated to instigate
              curvature transitions in a variety of developmental contexts.
              Folding a tissue requires that mechanical loads or geometric
              changes be non-uniform. Given that polarity is the most distinct
              and fundamental feature of epithelia, understanding epithelial
              folding mechanics hinges crucially on how forces become polarized
              and how polarized differential deformation arises, for which I

              modules of mechanical processes are distilled from a diverse
              array of epithelial folding events. Their mechanical

              within individual cells collectively generate tissue-level force
              during epithelial morphogenesis. During Drosophila mesoderm
              invagination, pulsed actomyosin meshwork contractions and a
              ratchet-like stabilization of cell shape drive apical
              constriction. Here, we investigate how contractile forces are
              integrated across the tissue. Reducing adherens junction (AJ)
              levels or ablating actomyosin meshworks causes tissue-wide
              epithelial tears, which release tension that is predominantly
              oriented along the anterior-posterior (a-p) embryonic axis.
              Epithelial tears allow cells normally elongated along the a-p
              axis to constrict isotropically, which suggests that apical
              constriction generates anisotropic epithelial tension that feeds
              back to control cell shape. Epithelial tension requires the
              transcription factor Twist, which stabilizes apical myosin II,
              promoting the formation of a supracellular actomyosin meshwork in
              which radial actomyosin fibers are joined end-to-end at spot AJs.
              Thus, pulsed actomyosin contractions require a supracellular,
              tensile meshwork to transmit cellular forces to the tissue level

  abstract = "Mitotic cells assume a spherical shape by increasing their
              surface tension and osmotic pressure by extensively reorganizing
              their interphase actin cytoskeleton into a cortical meshwork and
              their microtubules into the mitotic spindle. Mitotic entry is
              known to interfere with tissue morphogenetic events that require
              cell-shape changes controlled by the interphase cytoskeleton,
              such as apical constriction. However, here we show that mitosis
              plays an active role in the epithelial invagination of the
              Drosophila melanogaster tracheal placode. Invagination begins
              with a slow phase under the control of epidermal growth factor
              receptor (EGFR) signalling; in this process, the central apically
              constricted cells, which are surrounded by intercalating cells,
              form a shallow pit. This slow phase is followed by a fast phase,
              in which the pit is rapidly depressed, accompanied by mitotic
              entry, which leads to the internalization of all the cells in the
              placode. We found that mitotic cell rounding, but not cell
              division, of the central cells in the placode is required to
              accelerate invagination, in conjunction with EGFR-induced myosin
              II contractility in the surrounding cells. We propose that
              mitotic cell rounding causes the epithelium to buckle under
              pressure and acts as a switch for morphogenetic transition at the
              appropriate time.",

              requires a very large apical surface area, a feature that is
              enhanced by the presence of villi, fingerlike epithelial
              projections that extend into the lumen. Prior to villus
              formation, the epithelium is a thick pseudostratified layer. In
              mice, villus formation begins at embryonic day (E)14.5, when
              clusters of mesenchymal cells form just beneath the thick
              epithelium. At this time, analysis of the flat lumenal surface
              reveals a regular pattern of short apical membrane invaginations
              that form in regions of the epithelium that lie in between the
              mesenchymal clusters. Apical invaginations begin in the proximal
              intestine and spread distally, deepening with time.
              Interestingly, mitotically rounded cells are frequently
              associated with these invaginations. These mitotic cells are
              located at the tips of the invaginating membrane (internalized
              within the epithelium), rather than adjacent to the apical
              surface. Further investigation of epithelial changes during
              membrane invagination reveals that epithelial cells located
              between mesenchymal clusters experience a circumferential
              compression, as epithelial cells above each cluster shorten and
              widen. Using a computational model, we examined whether such
              forces are sufficient to cause apical invaginations. Simulations
              and in vivo data reveal that proper apical membrane invagination
              involves intraepithelial compressive forces, mitotic cell
              rounding in the compressed regions and apico-basal contraction of
              the dividing cell. Together, these data establish a new model
              that explains how signaling events intersect with tissue forces

               organisms is crucial for this purpose. One of the first
               essential steps to establish a species as an experimental model

               significant differences in morphology and timing affecting the
