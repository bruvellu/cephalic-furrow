## Notes

**2021-07-08**

- Incorporated revisions to abstract.

**2021-07-07**

- Revised the text in print and developed better the outline for the discussion
  and introduction.

**2021-07-05**

- Drafted summary figure with illustrations.

**2021-07-03**

- Finished illustrations for core figures.
- Included plots from Marina.


**2021-06-29**

- Drafted illustration of germ band cauterization.
- Changed plot coloring.
- Added tortuosity analysis files.

**2021-06-25**

- Included a PIV analysis of the tissue displacement during tissue buckling.

**2021-06-23**

- Made illustration for Figure 1 and adjusted the plot of fold depth.
- Re-plot folded area with latest theme and made adjustments to Figure 2.

**2021-06-21**

- Adjusted and improved Figure 1. Added more annotations, rearranged panels,
  added draft for illustration of developmental events, and moved panel of fold
  depth from Figure 2 to Figure 1.
- Wrote draft legend for Figure 1.


**2021-06-19**

- Major cleanup in the results revising the story and including the list of
  supporting Figures, Videos, Tables and Supplementary material.

**2021-06-18**

- Revamps the first paragraphs of results compiling information about the
  dynamics and properties of ectopic folds.

**2021-06-17**

- Adds fly stock and staging information, and few edits to results.

**2021-06-04**

- Changed area plot for furrow presentation.

**2021-05-31**

- Revises the introduction outline to a more direct storyline about the
  mechanical role of the cephalic furrow.
- Adds plot with maximum depth of cephalic furrows and ectopic folds in btd and
  eve mutant embryos.

**2021-05-28**

- Re-placing paragraph about tissue flows.

**2021-05-27**

- Edits paragraph about germ band cauterizations to include tortuosity results. 

**2021-05-26**

- Includes example plot for tortuosity analysis in cauterized mutants.
- Replaces example plot for real tortuosity analysis in cauterized mutants.

**2021-05-17**

- Removes wild type cauterization figure from compilation.

**2021-05-12**

- Adds row with earlier timepoint in the first figure.

**2021-05-11**

- Incorporates notes from yesterday and revised discussion draft paragraphs.

**2021-05-07**

- Adds placeholder paragraph for tissue flow analysis in cephalic furrow
  mutants.
- Merges the analysis of mitotic domains in the ectopic folding section.
- Removes wild type cauterizations from results and moved to the supplement for
  now. The observations are still crude and would add another level of
  complexity to the paper. They can fit a broader paper about the interactions
  of the cephalic furrow with other gastrulation movements.
- Revises the discussion section removing older paragraphs. Still requires some
  proper writing with references.

**2021-05-06**

- Updates the figure for mutant cauterizations. Removed placeholder for model,
  re-ordered panels, and replaced MZ2 panels.
- Updates the CF length plot with a couple of new control embryos in the figure
  for wildtype cauterizations.

**2021-05-03:**

- Updates panel with compiled traces for btd.

**2021-04-26:**

- Revises the section about mitotic domains and mutant cauterizations.
- Moves the modelling results to own section, for now.
- Revises the last section about wild type cauterizations.
- Just drafted the modelling paragraph.

**2021-04-23:**

- Updates the introduction to make it more coherent and up-to-date.
- Adds one key modelling paper about the global role of the CF.
- Revises the first section of the results about ectopic folds.

**2021-04-21:**

- Incorporates Marina's suggestions to manuscript.
- Updates figure of wild type cauterization with MD annotations.
- Updates the plot about CF length control vs cauterized.

**2021-04-20:**

- Includes a paragraph about the laser ablations and the active pull around the
  cephalic furrow.

**2021-04-19:**

- First draft of results with core figures. Some data still missing; need to
  export remaining videos.
- Introduction has paragraphs with key references and a summary paragraph, but
  needs to be steered the final story line.
- Discussion is outdated from an early outline, not for reading.
- Molecular data is on a standalone manuscript about slp, for now.
