# Ectopic folding coincides with peak strain

Strain analysis in the tissue shows that the peak strain coincides with the
mitotic domains and ectopic folds. This is different than in control embryos
where the cephalic furrow invaginates before the strain builds up. There is
also a gradual increase in strain more posterior at the trunk--germ interface.
