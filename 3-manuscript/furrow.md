# Abstract


# Introduction

In this project, I investigated the development of the cephalic furrow, a prominent but poorly understood epithelial invagination that demarcates the head-trunk boundary of Drosophila during gastrulation. Using multiplexed in situ hybridization and lightsheet microscopy, I analyzed known and newly-identified cephalic furrow genes to uncover the interplay between molecular patterning and morphogenesis of this invagination. My work extends the current knowledge on the cascade of genetic interactions patterning the head-trunk boundary of Drosophila, and provides insights about the role that the cephalic furrow plays in the complex tissue dynamics of gastrulation.


Next, I investigated the embryogenesis of cephalic furrow mutants under high-temporal resolution to uncover further details about the function of individual genes, and to reveal insights about the global role of the cephalic furrow during gastrulation.








# Results

## slp and eve demarcate the head-trunk boundary early

I analyzed the colocalization of slp, eve and btd expression from the onset of zygotic activation until gastrulation.

I discovered that slp and eve are expressed early in broad juxtaposing domains
that demarcate the head and trunk regions of the embryo, respectively, while
btd is upregulated at a later stage exactly at the interface between the slp
and eve territories.

The juxtaposing domains of slp and eve progressively resolve into narrow
abutting stripes that correspond to the single row of initiator cells giving
rise to the cephalic furrow.

## Early slp activity controls the final cephalic furrow position 

In embryos lacking functional slp genes, the cephalic furrow invagination is
delayed and shifted anteriorly, leading to an abnormal proportion of head and
trunk regions.

furrow.](../2-figures/slp-phenotype.png){#fig:slp-adjacent width=100%}

By analyzing the expression of key cephalic furrow genes in slp mutants, I
found that the typical overlap between the buttonhead (btd) domain and
even-skipped (eve) stripe 1 was intact, but shifted forward.

## slp identity linked to intercellular adhesion of adjacent cells

I found evidence that slp contributes to the normal behavior of initiator cells
at the onset of gastrulation.

In wild type embryogenesis, the rows immediately anterior and posterior to the
initiator cells express slp and are tightly coupled during the invagination
process.

In slp mutants, however, the intercellular adhesion between initiator and
adjacent cells is affected, suggesting that a slp might also play a role in the
patterning of cell identities within the cephalic furrow.

embryos.](../2-figures/slp-adjacent.png){#fig:slp-adjacent width=100%}

In addition, slp demarcates the outer limits of the cephalic furrow
invagination, but we do not know if it has a functional role in stopping the
mechanical push from the germ band.

## Weak cephalic furrow mutants disrupt invagination but not tissue buckling

In addition, I found that prd and gt mutants, which have a weak phenotype of
delayed cephalic furrow formation, in fact do not show a normal process of
invagination. Instead, the tissue buckles abruptly during germ band elongation,
having a similar outcome (an epithelial fold).

## btd mutants exhibit reminiscent initiator cell behavior

The live-imaging data revealed that btd mutants, which lack the cephalic
furrow, still exhibit reminiscent initiator cell behaviors at the head-trunk
interface.

## Head-trunk boundary is a tissue shearing zone

We analyzed the cell shape changes happening at the presumptive cephalic furrow
invagination site. We observe relative opposite tissue flows from the head and
trunk. Cell shape changes indicate compression forces on both sides with a
boundary zone in between exchanging neighbours.

## Strong cephalic furrow mutants show ectopic epithelial folds

In the absence of the cephalic furrow in btd and eve mutants, the embryos
invariably form ectopic epithelial folds throughout the head-trunk interface
during the process of germ band elongation.

mutants.](../2-figures/ectopic-folding.png){#fig:ectopic-folding width=100%}

## Ectopic folding is variable between individual embryos

These folding events are variable between individual embryos.

embryos.](../2-figures/ectopic-variability.png){#fig:ectopic-variability
width=100%}

## Ectopic occurs by tissue buckling between mitotic domains

Ectopic folds occur preferably between mitotic domains.

domains.](../2-figures/mitotic-domains.png){#fig:mitotic-domains
width=100%}

## Area and number of infolded epithelial cells is constant

We observed that mutant embryos that have a deep anterior fold, do not show
other folds. While mutant embryos with a shallower anterior fold have
additional folds more posterior.

area.](../2-figures/ectopic-area.png){#fig:ectopic-area width=100%}

## Blocking the germ band extension suppresses ectopic folding in cephalic furrow mutants

We tested whether mitotic domains are sufficient to cause ectopic epithelial
folds by mechanically blocking the germ band elongation in eve mutants using
laser cauterizations. We found that when the germ band is prevented from
elongating, the ectopic folds are no longer formed.

mutants.](../2-figures/cauterization-mutants.png){#fig:cauterization-mutants
width=100%}

## Blocking the germ band extension impacts the cephalic furrow invagination in normal embryogenesis

We also tested the impact of blocking the germ band elongation in wild type
embryos. When the germ band extension is blocked, the cephalic furrow
invagination is 30% shallower compared to control embryos.

![Cauterization blocking the germ band extension in wild type
embryos.](../2-figures/cauterization-wildtype.png){#fig:cauterization-wildtype
width=100%}

This indicates the germ band extension also impacts the cephalic furrow
invagination in normal embryogenesis, suggesting the cephalic furrow
morphogenesis is governed by the orchestration of genetic patterning with
mechanical forces in the embryo.

## Blocking the cephalic furrow in wild type causes ectopic buckling

If an excess of epithelia in association with mitotic domains and germ band
compression, we expect that by blocking the cephalic furrow, we would find
ectopic folding occurring in the epithelia. We blocked the cephalic furrow
invagination by cauterizing the row of initiator cells. We find the prediction
holds.

furrow.](../2-figures/cauterization-initiators.png){#fig:cauterization-initiators

## Cephalic furrow invagination actively increases tissue tension

Using laser ablations near the initiator cells we identified that there is an
increase in tension in an area of about 40 µm anterior and posterior.

## Mathematical model predicts ectopic folding and germ band compression

To better understand the forces at play we developed a model to compare to our
in vivo observations. The model is in line with the amount of excess tissue,
calculates the force needed for the epithelia to buckle, and the compression
from the germ band driving the folding.

# Discussion


My data suggests that slp activity is required for the proper positioning of the cephalic furrow along the anteroposterior axis.

These data suggest that early slp and eve interactions act upstream of btd, and
ultimately define the final position of the cephalic furrow invagination.




This suggests that btd function might not be required to specify the cephalic
furrow initiator cells.

The differences indicate that other forces might be contributing to formation
of the cephalic furrow.

Suggesting that mechanical forces acting in the monolayer epithelia, such as
the expansion of dividing cells, or the compression exerted by the germ band,
might be causally connected to the tissue buckling.

This indicates the germ band extension is the driving force underlying the
ectopic epithelial folding, and that mitotic domains facilitate but are not
sufficient to cause the tissue to buckle.






These data suggest that the head-trunk interface is under conflicting forces and cannot accommodate the expansion of head tissues caused by the mitotic domains, and the compression of trunk tissues caused by the germ band, without buckling. Therefore, the role that the cephalic furrow appears to accomplish during gastrulation is to anticipate these conflicts and prime, in a predictable manner, the position that the tissue will fold. In doing so, the cephalic furrow would prevent potential defects associated with erratic buckling, such as the compromise of cell-to-cell interactions or short-range signaling in the epithelia, and thus ensure a stereotypical balance of forces required for the precise patterning of embryonic tissues during gastrulation.

Altogether, the results originating from this project contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the complex genetic and physical interactions involved in the patterning and morphogenesis of the cephalic furrow in Drosophila.






The cephalic furrow invagination is the combination of an active movement initiated by the initiator cells pulling the tissue in around 40µm wide, as supported by the laser ablation experiments.

The invagination is further deepened by the tissue compressing caused by the germ band elongation onto the head-trunk region, as supported by the cauterization experiments in wild type and mutants.

Therefore, the cephalic furrow morphogenesis is a two-step process combining an active genetically defined process with a passive mechanically based process.

That's why is kind of rare to find cephalic furrow mutants and when they are identified they always form a fold anyway, because only the first step of the process has been genetically disrupted while the mechanical part of the process (from gb) was not.

The data then reveals how this balance flow between genetic and mechanical parameters integrate and interact with each other during gastrulation.

Giving insight into the connection between genetic and physical parameters that control morphogenesis.
